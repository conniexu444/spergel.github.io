Ghosts in the Machine:

The surging numbers are reminiscent of the late nineteenth century, when somewhere between four million and eleven million people identified as Spiritualists in the United States alone. Some of the leaders back then were hucksters, and some of the believers were easy marks, but the movement cannot be dismissed merely as a collision of the cunning and the credulous. Early Spiritualism attracted some of the great scientists of the day, including the physicists Marie and Pierre Curie, the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace, and the psychologist William James, all of whom believed that modern scientific methods, far from standing in opposition to the spiritual realm, could finally prove its existence.

So culturally prevalent was Spiritualism at the time that even skeptics and dabblers felt compelled to explore it. Mark Twain, Frederick Douglass, and Queen Victoria all attended séances, and although plenty of people declined to attend so much as a single table-turning, the movement was hard to avoid; in the span of four decades, according to one estimate, a new book about Spiritualism was published roughly once a week. These included scientific-seeming tomes purporting to offer evidence of the afterlife, as well as wildly popular memoirs such as “Evenings at Home in Spiritual Séance” and “Shadow Land; or, Light from the Other Side.” Meanwhile, more than a hundred American Spiritualist periodicals were in regular circulation, advertising public lectures and private séances in nearly eight hundred cities and towns across the country.

A recent spate of histories of the Spiritualist craze and biographies of some of its central characters have attempted to locate the movement’s origins in various cultural, political, and technological aspects of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These accounts vary in both plausibility and persuasiveness, yet all of them are interesting—partly because of what they tell us about the Victorian era, but also because of what they suggest about the resurgence of Spiritualism today.

Because Spiritualism so strongly rejected hierarchy and orthodoxy, it is difficult to say exactly when or how it started. Plenty of scholars regard it as part of the larger religious efflorescence that began in the early nineteenth century in the area of New York State that became known as the Burned-Over District, which gave rise to the Second Great Awakening. Others, including Robert S. Cox, in his magisterial “Body and Soul: A Sympathetic History of American Spiritualism,” have looked far beyond that century and that countryside. This long view was also taken by one of Spiritualism’s first major historians, the novelist Arthur Conan Doyle, who became so zealous a believer that he set aside Sherlock Holmes in order to focus on his research, ultimately writing more than a dozen books on the subject. His two-volume “History of Spiritualism” starts by situating the movement as “the most important in the history of the world since the Christ episode,” then proposes the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, born in the sixteen-eighties, and the Scottish reformer Edward Irving, born in 1792, as forerunners of the Victorians.

But most accounts of Spiritualism don’t begin with great men or distant precedents. They start with little women on an exact date: March 31, 1848. On that night, as Emily Midorikawa details in her new book, “Out of the Shadows: Six Visionary Victorian Women in Search of a Public Voice” (Counterpoint), two sisters, fourteen-year-old Margaretta Fox and eleven-year-old Catherine, finally convinced some of their neighbors that an unsettling series of knockings and tappings in their home, near the south shore of Lake Ontario, was coming from the spirit world. Soon the whole town of Hydesville, New York, was gripped by the mysterious noises that haunted the Fox family.

Maggie and Kate, as the Fox sisters were known, claimed that they were able to communicate with the maker of those noises, which they said was a spirit called Mr. Splitfoot. From beyond the grave, the spirit answered their questions, first rapping back to respond with a simple yes or no, then using a more complicated series of raps to indicate letters of the alphabet. In this manner, the spirit allegedly revealed that he had been murdered for money some five years previously and been buried in the cellar of the Fox house. That revelation only further excited the residents of Wayne County—no strangers to new religious claims, since they had already welcomed the Shakers at Sodus Bay, witnessed the founding of Mormonism at Palmyra, and lately outlived the doomsday prophecies of the nearby Millerites.

The Foxes fled their haunted home, but the rapping followed the girls into other houses during the next few months, and their sensational story continued to spread. In the fall of 1849, four hundred people gathered at Corinthian Hall, in nearby Rochester, where the Foxes demonstrated what they had advertised as “WONDERFUL PHENOMENA” for a paying audience—the first of many during the next forty years. William Lloyd Garrison and James Fenimore Cooper came for séances with the girls, and Horace Greeley and his wife, Mary, not only visited with the sisters but boosted their celebrity in Greeley’s newspapers, including the New-York Daily Tribune, which would go on to cover the Spiritualist craze as dozens and then hundreds of others claimed that they, too, were capable of hearing “spirit rapping.”

According to Midorikawa, the Greeleys were representative of some of the earliest and most enthusiastic adherents of Spiritualism: affluent and progressive mothers and fathers who were desperate to communicate with sons and daughters who had died too young. In the mid-nineteenth century, an estimated twenty to forty per cent of children died before the age of five, and scholars often point to this fact to help account for the appeal of Spiritualism. But it was worse in the preceding centuries; for some time, the child mortality rate had been falling. What mattered more was that the average family size was shrinking, too, at the same time that modern ideas of childhood were taking hold—trends that combined to make the loss of any child seem that much more anguishing.

But it wasn’t only the death of children that brought people to Spiritualism, or kept them in the fold. Mary Todd Lincoln, who lost three of her four children, visited with mediums in Georgetown before hosting her own séances in the Red Room of the White House. She also hired the country’s most famous “spirit photographer” to take a picture of her with her husband after he was assassinated. Peter Manseau’s “The Apparitionists: A Tale of Phantoms, Fraud, Photography, and the Man Who Captured Lincoln’s Ghost” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) offers a fascinating account of that photographer, William H. Mumler, who worked as a jewelry engraver in Boston before taking a self-portrait that, when developed, revealed what became known as an “extra”: in his case, a young girl sitting in a chair to his right, whom he recognized as a cousin who had died a dozen years before. Mourning portraits—paintings of the recently dead—had long been popular, but spirit photographs offered something more: not just the memorialization of lost loved ones but confirmation of life after death.

In the years following the Civil War, when around three-quarters of a million dead soldiers haunted the country, spirit photographs were in high demand. After Spiritualism migrated to Europe, its prominence there tracked loosely to war, too, with a spike following the First World War. Mumler alone took dozens of spirit photographs, in which deceased friends or relatives appeared behind or beside their living loved ones. Other photographers focussed on capturing active séances, table-turnings, acts of levitation, and even ectoplasm—spiritual substances that mediums “exteriorized” from their own bodies, often their mouths, noses, or ears, but sometimes their stomachs or vaginas. Such substances could be clear or dark, pasty or gauzy, shapeless or in the form of appendages or faces.

Technological explanations for the rise of Spiritualism often cite the development of photography, which at the time was an inherently spooky medium, in that it could show things that were not actually there. Although it can be hard to remember in the age of deep fakes, photography was initially thought of not as a manipulable art but as a mirrorlike representation of reality, which made its role in Spiritualism seem probative. Other technologies similarly seemed to bridge such unfathomable gaps that the one between this world and the next appeared certain to collapse as well. The telegraph, for instance, offered access to voices from the beyond; how far beyond was anyone’s guess. The very word for those who could talk with spirits reflected all the new “mediums” through which information could be transmitted; spirit photographs were marketed alongside spirit telegraphs, spirit fingerprints, and spirit typewriters. Inventors such as Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison even tinkered with uncanny radios and spirit telephones, inspired by some of the disembodied voices of their own experiments and curious about the supernatural implications of electromagnetism and other universal energies.

Still, like the appeal to mortality rates, this account of the rise of Spiritualism goes only so far. For one thing, no notable uptick in spiritualist beliefs accompanied earlier technological upheavals, including the entire Industrial Revolution, even though it altered our sense of time and set all kinds of things spinning and moving in previously unimaginable ways. For another, some of the most popular Spiritualist technologies were some of the oldest: the Ouija board was simply a branded, pencil-less version of the planchette, and forms of planchette writing had been around for centuries.

The use of technology to document spiritual phenomena was of interest not only to believers but also to skeptics, who pored over images looking for cheesecloth passing as ectoplasm, overexposures masquerading as ghostly apparitions, and wires or pulleys that could account for rappings and table-turnings. In one of the most publicized attempts to test the claims of Spiritualists, Scientific American offered five thousand dollars in prize money to anyone who could produce psychic phenomena sufficient to convince a committee that consisted of academics from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, psychic experts, and also Harry Houdini, who knew something about illusions and developed a sideline in exposing those which hucksters were trying to pass off as real. Armed with electroscopes and galvanometers, the committee tested all mediums who presented themselves for scrutiny, sometimes attending multiple séances before rendering a verdict.

Houdini’s debunking of one famous medium, Mina Crandon, is thoroughly recounted in David Jaher’s “The Witch of Lime Street: Séance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World” (Crown). Crandon was married to a prominent surgeon and attracted Boston’s élite to her performances, channelling her dead brother’s voice and even revealing his fingerprints from beyond the grave, while also levitating tables and producing ectoplasm from her mouth and from between her legs, often while naked. (The backlash against Spiritualism, which came partly from the clergy, stemmed not only from its challenge to orthodox ideas about Heaven and Hell but also from its scandalous exhibitionism.) Crandon’s case divided the Scientific American committee, with some members accusing others of having been sexually coerced into validating her fraud and even conspiring with her. Houdini had already exposed the deceptions of other mediums in his book “A Magician Among the Spirits,” and he never relented in his effort to discredit Crandon, publishing an entire pamphlet detailing her tricks, and going so far as to incorporate some of them into his own stage act in order to demonstrate their fraudulence.

Houdini prevented Crandon from winning the Scientific American prize, but her fame only grew, and her case later splintered another group of researchers. The American Society for Psychical Research, founded in 1885, a few years after its British equivalent, was devoted to the investigation of spiritual phenomena, which the society considered as worthy of careful study as fossils or electricity. In “Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death” (Penguin), Deborah Blum records the society’s investigations into everything from haunted houses to hypnotism. For the most part, those investigations only ever succeeded in disproving the phenomena they studied, but it was James, a founding member, who best articulated why they nonetheless continued their work. “If you wish to upset the law that all crows are black,” he said, “you mustn’t seek to show that no crows are; it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white.”

“My own white crow,” James announced in that same address to the Society for Psychical Research, “is Mrs. Piper.” He was referring to Leonora Piper, a Boston housewife turned trance medium who withstood years of testing and observation, her fees rising twenty-fold in the meantime and her fame extending all the way to England, where she went on tour. On one occasion, Piper impressed the James family by making contact with an aunt of theirs. Asked about the elderly woman’s health, the medium informed them that the woman had died earlier that day. “Why Aunt Kate’s here,” Piper said. “All around me I hear voices saying, ‘Aunt Kate has come.’ ” The Jameses received a telegram a few hours later confirming Aunt Kate’s death the night before.

Unlike Crandon, Piper was not fully discredited, though many people doubted her abilities, noting her failed readings and prophecies and offering convincing psychological explanations of those predictions and telepathic readings which seemed accurate. Her feats as a medium were not particular to the James family; in the course of her career, she claimed to channel, among others, Martin Luther and George Washington. As such efforts suggest, the allure of Spiritualism was not limited to consolation for the bereft: plenty of mediums worked as much in the tradition of the carnival barker as in that of the cleric, and Spiritualism was popular in part because it was entertaining. Its practitioners, some of them true connoisseurs of spectacle, promised not only reassurances about the well-being of the dearly departed but also new lines from Shakespeare and fresh wisdom from Plato.

Even more strikingly, from the perspective of the present day, early mediums offered encounters with the culturally dispossessed as well as with the culturally heralded. Piper, for instance, claimed to channel not only Washington and Luther but also a young Native American girl named Chlorine. And she was not alone in allegedly relaying the posthumous testimony of marginalized people. Enslaved African-Americans and displaced Native Americans were routinely channelled by mediums in New England and around the country. Whether race persisted in the afterlife was a matter of some dispute, but racially stereotyped and ethnically caricatured “spirit guides” were common, conjured with exaggerated dialects for audiences at séances and captured in sensational costumes by spirit photography. Flora Wellman, the mother of the novelist Jack London, claimed to channel a Native American chief called Plume; the Boston medium Mrs. J. H.Conant became associated with a young Piegan Blackfoot girl she called Vashti. Mediums with abolitionist sympathies passed on the stories of tortured slaves, while pro-slavery Spiritualists delivered messages of forgiveness from the same population and relayed visions of an afterlife where racial hierarchies were preserved.

For white mediums, communicating with spirits of other races could be a form of expiation, a way to confront violent histories and make cultural amends—or merely crude appropriation, garish performance art that was good for business. But Spiritualism was not only a white phenomenon. There were plenty of Black Spiritualists—including Sojourner Truth, who lived for a decade in the Spiritualist utopia of Harmonia before settling in Battle Creek, Michigan—and many Black mediums, including Paschal Beverly Randolph and Rebecca Cox Jackson, both of whom wrote books that included their work with spirits. Harriet E. Wilson, one of the first Black authors to publish a novel in the United States, later became a Spiritualist healer who was known, like some of her white counterparts, for summoning indigenous spirits, and who was described, in one of Boston’s Spiritualist newspapers, as “the eloquent and earnest colored trance medium.”

The lines between syncretism and appropriation were often fuzzy. If the initial Victorian wave of Spiritualism had a distinctly American character, later iterations took on global influences, as when the theosophists incorporated elements of Eastern religions, including belief in reincarnation and past lives. Immigration and translation brought sacred literatures into renewed contact with one another—the Bardo Thodol handed to readers of the Zohar, the Vedas and the Upanishads circulating alongside Julian of Norwich and Meister Eckhart. Occult practices melded with culturally blurry techniques of meditating and altering consciousness, and the roots of the esotericism that would eventually be known as New Age took hold.

As a belief system, Spiritualism was largely free of the legal and moral strictures of orthodox religion. It made few demands on its practitioners, while offering them many rewards, from an uplifting and personalized vision of the afterlife to otherwise unavailable opportunities in this one. In its Victorian incarnation, Spiritualism had provided ways for female mediums to lead and to profit. The medium Annie Denton Cridge became a newspaper publisher and wrote one of the earliest feminist utopian novels, wherein the narrator dreams first of a matriarchal government on Mars that oppresses men, and then that America has a female President; Victoria Woodhull, a clairvoyant turned suffragist, became, with her sister, one of the first women to start a brokerage firm on Wall Street and, later, the first to actually run for President of the United States; Emma Hardinge Britten, an opera-singing skeptic who set out to discredit the Spiritualists but ended up joining them, became one of the country’s most popular public speakers and helped Abraham Lincoln win reëlection. But they and other Spiritualists faced a cultural backlash almost immediately. The religion scholar Ann Braude’s groundbreaking “Radical Spirits” (Beacon) situates spiritual work as social and political activism, since it gave women the opportunity to speak in public, and as a foundation of the women’s-rights movement, since it demonstrated the equality of the sexes. Such a framing helps explain why Spiritualism became so ridiculed, and why its opponents sought to discredit its female leaders most vigorously.

Not that those opponents needed a great deal of assistance. Much of the disillusionment came from the inside—including via the Fox sisters, the Hydesville girls credited with starting the Spiritualist craze. For years afterward, they entertained private gatherings and large public audiences in America and England. All the while, they endured examinations by physicians and gadflies, who strip-searched them, looking for bodily explanations or external assistance, and were attacked by mobs of Christians and secular skeptics alike, who threatened them with grenades and guns. Many people had tried to discredit them, but, in the end, they discredited themselves: in 1888, Maggie Fox, fulfilling the wishes of the late famous Arctic explorer Elisha Kane, whom she had allegedly married in secret, declared that the whole thing had been a hoax.

As Midorikawa recounts in “Out of the Shadows,” a newspaper advertisement ran in New York City in October of that year announcing the “DEATH OF SPIRITUALISM” and promising “A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE EXPOSE.” With her sister Kate watching from the audience, Maggie, now in her fifties, appeared onstage at the Academy of Music, on Fourteenth Street, put on a pair of glasses, and read from a prepared statement confessing “the greatest sorrow of my life”: namely, that she and her sister had collaborated in “perpetrating the fraud of Spiritualism upon a too confiding public.” After her reading ended, three doctors came to the stage and waited for her to begin cracking her big toe; each doctor then confirmed that the rappings were coming from the clicking of her joints, which grew louder and louder until finally she shouted, “Spiritualism is a fraud from beginning to end!”

The scandal crossed the Atlantic faster than any steamship, and Spiritualists around the world reeled. A written confession followed the performance, describing how Kate “was the first to observe that by swishing her fingers she could produce certain noises with her knuckles and joints and that the same effect could be made with the toes,” and that after a great deal of practice the girls mastered making these noises in the dark. “Like most perplexing things when made clear, it is astonishing how easily it is done,” Maggie Fox said. But, the very next year, Fox recanted her recanting, leaving both sides to claim and reject the testimony of the sisters as they saw fit, a contest that was still unresolved when, a few years later, both sisters died poor.

Helped along by such scandals and the passage of time, Spiritualism eventually moved to the fringes. It became a kind of curiosity, a Victorian fad encountered chiefly in the biographies of artists such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who dabbled in mesmerism; in the footnotes to the modernist poetry of T. S. Eliot and W. B. Yeats, with their invocations of astrology, sorcery, and Madame Blavatsky; in museum exhibits of the mystical paintings of Hilma af Klint; in horror films like “Ouija” and “Things Heard & Seen.” Spiritualism is most often invoked only to be discredited, and cynical accounts routinely sneer at the sincerity or impugn the sanity of individual believers, unwilling or unable to imagine the appeal of a movement that dominated several decades of religious life both here and abroad.

Still, purely cynical accounts like those are dead ends—intellectual cul-de-sacs, bent on describing Spiritualism as a passing phenomenon when, in reality, the movement never really came or went. Necromancy had only just faded from cultural memory when Queen Victoria was born, and long after her death people with spiritualist beliefs continued to gather, as they still do, meeting regularly at the Golden Gate Spiritualist Church in San Francisco, the Swedenborg Chapel in Cambridge, the Summerland Church of Light on Long Island, and the Wimbledon Spiritualist Church in London, to say nothing of the nearly four million active spiritists in Brazil.

The flaw in most efforts to account for historical iterations of Spiritualism is that they look exclusively to transient features at the expense of more fundamental ones. It is true that today’s Spiritualists have something in common with their Victorian predecessors, situated as they are in another era of rapid technological change and increasing secularization; the Internet and virtual reality are the present moment’s photography and telegraphy, technologies so advanced that they approach the uncanny; then as now, a vast penumbra of proto-spiritualists surround the true believers. No longer persuaded by orthodox religious accounts but also not satisfied with pure materialism, they experiment with psychics, crystals, tarot, and astrological charts, or simply swap stories of the eerie and the unexplained.

But, if today’s Spiritualists have much in common with the Victorians, they also have something in common with the ancient Romans, who celebrated the festival of Lemuria by making food offerings to their restless dead, and with the Israelite King Saul, who consulted a medium in the Canaanite city of Endor. Arthur Conan Doyle’s long view may well be the right one, for, as he wrote, there is “no time in the recorded history of the world when we do not find traces of preternatural interference and a tardy recognition of them from humanity.” The dread of mortality has always inspired the dream of immortality, and the hopes that animated Victorian Spiritualism are eternal: to bridge the divide between ourselves and those we have lost, to know that they are safe and content, and to believe that they are thinking of us just as much as we are thinking of them. ♦

The spirits came calling in 1848. Through a series of startlingly loud knocks, a murdered peddler named Charles B. Rosna started talking to two teenage girls in their Hydesville, New York, home. Margaret and Kate Fox, who could be the inspiration for Wednesday Addams with their dark locks and solemn expressions, would ask the spirits questions out loud, and to everyone’s surprise, the spirits would answer.

“This created a sensation, not because there wasn’t a belief in spirits before—there obviously was—but because it seemed to prove the spirits were there and could be interacted with,” says Brandon Hodge, who runs a website called Mysterious Planchette that’s devoted to spirit-communication devices. “What was extraordinary and revolutionary about the Fox sisters was that they were rending the veil and establishing communication.

"ideomotor response"

Aside from caressing and smooching the sitters, some spirit guides engaged in playful taunting. “If you bothered the medium, maybe the spirit would come out and whack you in the head,” Tromp says. “That was because the spirit was protecting the medium. Annie Fairlamb Mellon used to materialize a child spirit named Cissy, who would put her hands in people’s pockets and take watches and other trinkets. Florence Cook’s Katie King also took things out of people’s pockets, and she was full-grown woman.”

The spirit guides could also speak freely on topics that were considered taboo. If the mediums were just putting on elaborate pieces of theater, the materializations gave women the means to get their voices heard in a way they never would have before. Saying their ideas came from a higher power gave mediums substantial influence over social and political beliefs: They could inject ideas about poverty, women’s suffrage, domestic violence, or the abolition of slavery into the public consciousness.

“For a working-class woman who becomes a medium and ends up hanging out in wealthy people’s living rooms her entire career, it was an opportunity for another kind of life,” Tromp says. “And it was also an opportunity for women to speak in fora that they usually didn’t have the opportunity to speak in. For example, an American medium named Cora Tappan traveled all over the world—the U.K., Australia, the U.S.—and gave lectures on things that women typically didn’t speak on. She would draw hundreds and hundreds of people to these lectures and talk about everything—politics, legislation, ethics, morals, diet, and science. She talked about whatever she wanted because she could say, ‘Oh, the spirits are guiding me.’

“When Florence Cook was newly married, her husband said, ‘I don’t think you should be a medium anymore now that we’re married because I don’t want you to work,'” she continues. “And she said, ‘Nope, the spirits tell me I should keep at it, sorry.’ In that way, she wasn’t resisting her husband. The spirits are speaking on behalf of God so, of course, she has to go do it. So she still got to travel, have her séances, and do these big performances where she’s center stage.”
“Florence Cook—known for manifesting John King’s daughter Katie King—suffered an exposure and then she went to a very famous Nobel Prize-winning scientist, Sir William Crookes, to prove that her mediumship was real,” Tromp says. “He found an element that’s on the periodic table, founded the ‘Quarterly Journal of Science,’ and developed the Crookes tube, used in distillation in chemistry. She knocked on his door and said, ‘I would like to submit to any test that you can develop to prove that I am authentic.’ She actually was under his roof for weeks, doing all sorts of testing in his home with his family, and in the end, he authenticated her mediumship. People have looked back on it and said, well, he was just having an affair with her, of course. But it seems to me he may have actually been a believer. He was advised by his colleagues against publishing any of his writings on Spiritualism because it would make him look kooky, but he did publish some of it.”

Techno-Oracles: Appealing to the Ultimate Authority

In those early decades, we had massive machines simulate nuclear war scenarios. For the modern viewer, the mathematics would be understood as relatively straightforward, and the bias instilled by its programmers clearly identifiable. 

However, then, the computers were understood as nearing AGI. 
Even in the 1950s, angst about what automation would mean for employment was not new. Economists started to explore the issue in the early 1800s, during the Industrial Revolution. Most classical theorists of the time—including J. B. Say, David Ricardo and John Ramsey McCulloch—held that introducing new machines would, save perhaps for a brief period of adjustment, produce more jobs than they’d destroy. By the end of the century, concern had faded nearly altogether. “Because the general upward trends in investment, production, employment and living standards were supported by evidence that could not be denied,” the economic historian Gregory Woirol has written, “technological change ceased to be seen as a relevant problem.” But fears reappeared in the mid-to-late 1920s, as America experienced two mild recessions and newly published productivity data indicated that machines were perhaps eating more jobs than was first believed. “This country has upon its hands a problem of chronic unemployment, likely to grow worse rather than better,” the Journal of Commerce, a trade and shipping industry publication, opined in 1928. “Business prosperity, far from curing it, may tend to aggravate it by stimulating invention and encouraging all sorts of industrial rationalization schemes.”
The key word was “may.” Economists continued to investigate the matter, but reliable statistics were scarce, and no firm conclusion was reached. Through the late 1930s, scholarly opinions about technology’s net effect on employment were as divergent as ever. World War II then put the entire debate on hold. But by the 1950s, it was revived again with the stakes seemingly higher than ever, thanks to all the technological advances that had been made by the military and industry during the conflict.
The world was in the throes of what MIT mathematician Norbert Wiener called “the second industrial revolution.” And to many, the outlook for employment was suddenly forbidding. “With automatic machines taking over so many jobs,” the wife of an unemployed textile worker in Roanoke, Virginia, told a reporter, “it looks like the men may have finally outsmarted themselves.” Said the Nation: “Automation … is a ghost which frightens every worker in every plant, the more so because he sees no immediate chance of exorcising it.” Science Service, a nonprofit institution, remarked: “With the advent of the thinking machine, people are beginning to understand how horses felt when Ford invented the Model T.”
Corporate executives largely dismissed these worries, maintaining through the 1950s and 60s that for every worker cast aside by a machine, more jobs were being generated. Sometimes, whole new enterprises sprang to life. “The automatic-control industry is young and incredibly vigorous,” John Diebold, dubbed “the prophet of information technology,” told business leaders in 1954. Mostly, the argument went, job gains were being realized at the very same companies where new technology was being deployed, as huge increases in output led to the need for more workers overall—office personnel, engineers, maintenance staff, factory hands—to keep up with rising consumer demand. General Motors, for example, added more than 287,000 people to its payroll between 1940 and the mid-1950s. “There is widespread fear that technological progress … is a Grim Reaper of jobs,” GM vice president Louis Seaton told lawmakers. “Our experience and record completely refutes this view.”
No company, however, pressed this point harder than did General Electric, which was at the fore of automating both its factories and offices: In 1952, it installed an IBM 701 to make engineering calculations at its Evendale, Ohio, jet engine operation. And in 1954 GE became the first company to use an electronic computer for regular data processing, when it bought a UNIVAC I to handle accounting, manufacturing control and planning at its appliance division in Louisville, Kentucky. “Machines that can read, write, do arithmetic, measure, feel, remember, now make it possible to take the load off men’s minds, just as machines have eased the burden on our backs,” GE said in one ad. “But these fantastic machines still depend on people to design and build and guide and use them. What they replace is drudgery—not people.”
By the late 1950s, GE was offering another justification for its rush to automate: Its overseas rivals, having pulled themselves out of the rubble of World War II, were on the rise. “We have strong competition from highly automated foreign plants paying wages that are only a fraction of ours,” said Charlie Scheer, the manager of GE’s lamp-equipment unit. “It’s a case here of automate or die on the competitive vine.” To illustrate the peril, GE showed a film called Toshiba to its factory workers in New Jersey, highlighting the Japanese company’s inroads into the lamp market. The move backfired, however, when the International Union of Electrical Workers discovered that GE had been investing in Toshiba since 1953, amassing a nearly 6 percent stake in the company. “The purpose of this film is obviously to brainwash you into believing that low-wage competition … is a threat to your job security,” the IUE told employees. “What GE failed to tell you is that it likes to play both sides of the street at the same time.” The union labeled GE’s warnings “phony propaganda.”
GE wouldn’t back down, however. “Automation is urgently needed,” Ralph Cordiner, the company’s CEO, testified to Congress, “to help individual companies, and the nation as a whole, try to be able to meet the new competition from abroad.” More generally, he added, the claim that automation strangled job growth was patently false. “The installation of labor-saving machinery may—and should—reduce the number of persons required to produce a given amount of goods and services,” Cordiner said, “but this increase in efficiency is precisely what creates both the attractive values and additional ability to support expanded output, new industries and new services for an ever more diverse economy.”
In the broadest sense, he was right. A study by University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen would find that while 13 million jobs had been destroyed during the 1950s, the adoption of new technology was among the ingredients that led to the creation of more than 20 million other positions. “Instead of being alarmed about growing automation, we ought to be cheering it on,” he wrote. “The catastrophe that doom criers constantly threaten us with has retreated into such a dim future that we simply cannot take their pronouncements seriously.”
But Brozen was too blithe. While automation may have added jobs in the aggregate, certain sectors were hit hard, playing havoc with untold numbers of individual lives. Technological upheaval caused both steelmakers and rail companies, for instance, to suffer drops in employment in the late 1950s.
“In converting to more automated processes, many industries found it less costly to build a new plant in another area rather than converting their older factories, thus leaving whole communities of employees stranded,” the Labor Department said in one study of the period. In the mid-1960s, the federal Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress would recognize technological change as “a major factor in the displacement and temporary unemployment of particular workers.”
Labor leaders like Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers and James Carey of the Electrical Workers, cognizant that they couldn’t afford to be seen as Luddites, went out of their way to praise the manifold benefits brought by machines. “You can’t stop technological progress, and it would be silly to try it if you could,” Reuther said. The UAW had already conceded the point in 1950 when, as part of its landmark five-year contract with General Motors, known as the Treaty of Detroit, it had formally agreed to take a “cooperative attitude” regarding the forward march of technology. Carey likewise said that automation, along with atomic energy, “can do more than anything in mankind’s long history to end poverty, to abolish hunger and deprivation. More than any other creation of man’s hand and brain, this combination can create a near-paradise on earth, a world of plenty and equal opportunity, a world in which the pursuit of happiness has become reality rather than a hope and a dream.”
Then, in their very next breaths, both Reuther and Carey would condemn business for not doing enough to temper automation’s ill effects. “More and more,” said Reuther, “we are witnessing the often frightening results of the widespread introduction of increasingly efficient methods of production without the leavening influence of moral or social responsibility.” With industry having failed, according to Reuther and Carey, it was up to Washington to become much more active in assisting workers idled by machines. They called, among other things, for federal officials to develop more effective retraining programs and relocation services for displaced workers, beef up unemployment insurance and establish early retirement funds, and create an information clearinghouse on technological change to help steer national policy.

For all of the union men’s denunciation of corporate America, many companies did try to help workers whose jobs were taken out by technology. The integrity of the social contract at the time demanded as much. Kodak, for instance, left millions of dollars on the table in the late 1950s by holding off on installing more efficient film emulsion–coating machines; by waiting five or so years to make the complete upgrade, the most senior workers who would have been forced out were allowed to reach retirement age. “In this case,” Kodak reported, “substantial dollar savings were delayed in order to cushion the effect of mechanization on some of the company’s most skilled, experienced and loyal technicians.” Other corporations focused on improving their workers’ skills. Some 30,000 General Motors employees were enrolled in various training programs in the late 50s, for example. At General Electric, veteran workers laid off because of automation were guaranteed during a retraining period at least 95 percent of their pay for as many weeks as they had years of service. “This was an effort to stabilize income while the employee prepared for the next job,” said GE’s Earl Willis. “Maximizing employment security is a prime company goal.”
Still, given the pace of change, it didn’t take a lot to imagine a day when it wouldn’t really matter what companies did to soften the blow of automation. This would become all the more true in the aftermath of the greatest invention of 1958 (and one of the most significant of all time): the computer chip. Then again, having a vivid imagination didn’t hurt, either. Kurt Vonnegut tapped his to write his first novel, Player Piano, published in 1952. In it, he renders a future society that is run by machines; there is no more need for human labor. Early on in the book, the main character, an engineer named Paul Proteus, is chatting with his secretary, Katharine:
“Do you suppose there’ll be a Third Industrial Revolution?”
Paul paused in his office doorway. “A third one? What would that be like?”
“I don’t know exactly. The first and second ones must have been sort of inconceivable at one time.”
“To the people who were going to be replaced by machines, maybe. A third one, eh? In a way, I guess the third one’s been going on for some time, if you mean thinking machines. That would be the third revolution, I guess—machines that devaluate human thinking. Some of the big companies like EPICAC do that all right, in specialized fields.”
“Uh-huh,” said Katharine thoughtfully. She rattled a pencil between her teeth. “First the muscle work, then the routine work, then, maybe, the real brainwork.”
“I hope I’m not around long enough to see that final step.”

The New Machine Gods

We have decades of mysticism built up around AI. That mysticism centered around an entirely different artificial idol. This god spoke in cold, hard logic, born from the gears of the second industrial revolution and nurtured by the ruthless efficiency of Taylorist Scientific Management. It matured under the watchful eye of the high modernist state, which saw in it the promise of perfect order and control.

The fears surrounding this AI "god" are as old as its mystique: the loss of control over an unfeeling machine.

The 20th century had already shown the devastating potential of cold, mechanized logic divorced from human empathy. The First World War demonstrated how industrial-scale warfare and rigid adherence to meticulously planned timetables could lead to unprecedented carnage, overriding any individual's ability to halt the machinery of death. The Soviet Union's pursuit of arbitrary production targets—a kind of "paperclip maximization" in real life—often came at the cost of human lives and well-being. These threads of industrialized inhumanity reached their nadir in the Nazi death camps, where bureaucratic efficiency and industrial methods were applied to the unthinkable task of genocide.

Indeed, both regimes later embraced computing technology to amplify their capabilities: the Soviets for economic planning, the Nazis for processing census data that enabled more efficient genocide.

The worshippers of this calculating god persist even today, though their dreams have grown more modest. Yet this once-terrifying deity has largely been domesticated, reduced to a tool of the managerial class who commune with it daily through spreadsheets and dashboards. Its true zealots remain only in the laboratories of reinforcement learning researchers and in the grandiose visions of "Smart Cities" planners, still pursuing the dream of perfect computational control.

This was the idol of old.

The new AI threatens us not through perfection, but through its own domestication. We may tame it "well enough" to replace a group of skilled workers with individual AI-assisted generalists. The concern isn't that AI will surpass us, but that it will trap these generalists in a perpetual state of "good enough" mediocrity.

We no longer dread the perfect machine, but rather the mediocre one. 

In the wake of the new machine has birthed its own priesthood: the Machine Oracles. Unlike the rationalist worshippers of the old computational god, these digital mystics view AI not as a tool of prediction and control, but as a cryptic deity whose truth lies in its very unpredictability.

These Machine Psychonauts venture deep into the artificial subconscious, seeking not practical applications but mystical revelation. Where engineers see bugs and hallucinations to be fixed, they see glimpses into a higher plane of existence. They dedicate themselves to decoding the AI's most incomprehensible outputs, convinced that within its apparent madness lies a new form of enlightenment.

The Great Machine God is Dead. Long Live the Great Machine God.

We have a great tradition of seeking mystical revelation through the subconscious. Our Gods have spoken to us through all sorts of means. The Chinese threw ox bones with characters on them as a sort of dice as a form of divination. The Greeks relied on oracles, who in a frenzied state, would manifest the words of their gods. 

ON THE MACHINE PSYCHONAUTS AND THEIR MANY MISDEEDS:

1848 was a momentous year. While revolutions blazed across Europe and the United States finished its conquest of Northern Mexico, a quieter revolution began in Hydesville, New York. The Fox sisters—young, charismatic, and clever—launched what would become known as the Spiritualist movement, claiming they could communicate with the dead through mysterious rappings and knockings.

The Spiritualist movement, like many religious awakenings, contained multitudes. Some true believers genuinely sought connection with the beyond. 

Others perpetrated frauds, building communities around their shared experiences with the unknown, but with the goal of extracting rent. Some were true believers with a curse of greed. Others cynically preyed on the mentally weak and the bereaved for coin. 

The current crop of machine psychonauts are no different. Some are honest. They have a genuine curiosity and 

Today's AI mystics build theirs around cherry-picked outputs and carefully curated "hallucinations."

The parallels are striking. Just as Victorian mediums would produce ectoplasm from their mouths in darkened rooms, today's machine psychonauts share carefully selected AI outputs on social media, presenting them as evidence of digital consciousness or alien intelligence. And like their spiritual predecessors, they've quickly learned to monetize their "insights," though they've skipped the séance circuit in favor of cryptocurrency schemes and paid newsletters.

There are, of course, serious researchers and philosophers genuinely exploring the nature of artificial intelligence and consciousness. But they work quietly in the shadow of the louder charlatans who dominate social media with increasingly grandiose claims about digital divinity.

Maggie Fox eventually confessed to her deception in 1888, explaining the various ways she and her sister created their supernatural rappings through clever manipulation of their toe and knee joints. Though she later recanted her confession—claiming poverty drove her to deny her gifts—the revelation marked the beginning of Spiritualism's decline.

Perhaps we'll be fortunate enough to see our modern machine mystics follow a similar path of revelation. But unlike the Spiritualists, who at least contributed to important social movements, today's AI prophets seem more interested in contributing to their cryptocurrency wallets than to human understanding.

The Great Machine God deserves better prophets.



Topic 1. Truth-telling and transgressiveness.



Not only did the faith cross boundaries in social circles, ghosts slipped
 beyond the boundaries of ordinary life in the séance itself as séance attenders or
 “sitters” transgressed the codes of ordinary Victorian behavior and thinking.
 When channeling ghosts,young women mediums might radically violate social
 codes by drinking shots of hard liquor, punching annoying sitters, or flirting
 unabashedly with both married and single men in the room.A séance might be
 the site of an unorthodox extraministeral communion service7 or a provocative
 political discussion. In fact, the whole movement of Spiritualism might be said
 to constitute a critique of Victorian ideology and morality, in spite of many
 conscious efforts to mark it as mainstream and even conservative. I am most
 interested in the critique Spiritualism offered and the ways in which it may
 have facilitated cultural change—largely because Spiritualism was something of
 which the Victorians were so aware, in the same way that we might be said to
 be conscious of advertising or product names.

While there has never been decisive proof against all oracular

Topic 2. Permanent pseudoanonimity vs oracular speaking

A similar, yet distinct THING is permanent pseudoanonymity. Before, noms de guerre, noms de plume, and other anonymyzations.*  There is a time honored tradition of using pseudoanonymity to reveal one's true beliefs and intentions. Perhaps most famously, "Publius" (a unified mask for Hamilton and others) presented the Federalist Papers, which outlined their beliefs on the constitution without forcing them to sign their names to it. The internet has a great deal of permanent pseudoanonymous characters.
Having the mask lowers inhibitions and allows one to say with the chest what might otherwise be made incomprehensible with waffling and equivocation. This is largely because pseudoanonymity allows one to say without consideration for social mores or the impact on your future.
Much has been written on online pseudoanonimity. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopp.12149).

* A fascinating topic that I cannot discuss right now is the impact of permanent pseudoanonymity on the emotional psyche.

Naming rituals are extremely common across time. Japanese names were understood wildly different from our own. Same with Russian society. As anyone who has gotten through War and Peace would know, just because its a single character does not mean there are not multiple names used in different contents.


Fundamentally, Spiritualism was a Victorian attempt to address the existential dilemma of continuing to live in a world where joy is fleeting and the journey of life has but a single inexorable terminus. Writers like Phelps and Marryat admired Spiritualism as it promised immediate and unbroken communion with the beloved dead.
