The new must define itself against the old. In order to do so, it must understand the old. In so doing, it cannot help but love the old. The other way is to forever echo the old without knowledge, eternally stuck with the feeling of moving forward.

Oldness cannot help but pass into oblivion, forever remembered as how the new remembered it and how the new came to love it. The other way is death.

Art Nouveau is a movement composed of those who seek to understand and love both of these truths. 

Art Nouveau sees no distance between form and function. It desires art both high and applied, dynamic with movement while retaining the beauty of nature and of the classics, and the use of modern materials and methods to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.


#This might be repetitive
Art nouveau is a modern woman and a mother. She dreams of a better world for her children and shares their vision of creating. She is an eternal optimist yet she remains wary of the unintended effects of creation.
She cannot live like her parents but has come to terms with and loves them and shares their love of what was. She loves her memories of the past but knows better than to long for those memories.

There are two great critics of art noveau: The grandfather and the grandchild.

The grandfather hates art nouveau because of its crass commercialism, its embrace of metropolitianism, and its enthusiastic acceptance of the future.
To him, in fact, there is no distance between the three.

To him, the art nouveau-ist gently smiles, embraces her father, backs up her head, and tells him
"I couldn't imagine being here without you. See how I took inspiration from the beautiful art you made only yesterday. I want to share its beauty with the whole world. And I want the whole world to love the art I made based off of what you made. But you know beauty cannot be but held still. It must move forward."

She asks if he remembers his complaints about the past, how everything was uncomfortable.  and how happy he must be that his grandson need not understand his complains.


The grandson hates art nouveau because he wants to create something new while abjuring the past. He says: 
"One must simply create, because creation is useless, unrewarded, ignored, despised; in a word, heroic. 
To the poetry of nostalgic memory we oppose the poetry of feverish expectation.""

The art nouveauist looks dotingly down at her son, gives him a great smile:
"Oh clever little one, your time will come."

She asks if he remembers the time he "invented" the snow cone by pouring his hot chocolate, which had gone cold, over some snow? And how he cried when grandpa told him that snow cones were older than sin?

"Don't you want to make sure you're inventing something truly new? Don't you think grandpa wanted to create something new when he was your age? You still have so much to learn"

When the son gets pouty and declares that everyone before him was a fool and that there is a whole new world to be built.
When the grandfather declares that there is no beauty in the new and that technology makes us less happy in the end.

She replies "Why don't you two go down to the new ice cream parlor. Grandpa can tell you about what they ate before there was ice cream. You can tell him all about what you learned in school about the endothermic effect and how the flavor could not exist without new technology."

And all were content.

The Art Nouveau-ist believes:

Function should define form.
Art should be inspired and guided by nature's logic and patterns.
Art should adapt to conditions and environment.
Art should acknowledge its place in history while looking to the future.
Art should embrace new technologies and materials in service of beauty.



I THINK I SHOULD REMOVE THE BELOW

She has one great fear. Her fear has been fulfilled before and she knows it may be fulfilled yet again. That is the fear that the great and wonderful technologies she uses to create art will be used for war.
She fearfully stockpiles the newest of armaments while longing of a future with no arms. She hates that the tools she creates to make the world happier and more beautiful can be used for war. Even more she hates the fact that she may be the one who has to use these weapons against others.
She is further sickened by the fact that even in the horrible warships and weapons, she can still see the beauty. The beauty of machinery working as intended, the beauty of newness powering over oldness. She knows the great tales of war, however false they may be, and feels their appeal.
She saw it happen in 1914. The fertilizer factories she made to make the world a beautiful garden with food for all were used to create horrible gases that blinded and killed.
The beautiful planes she created to see the rest of the world and see it from a new angle were used to bomb and wreak havoc.
Her engines were used to create colossal war machines.

And so she remains ever vigilant and wary.
