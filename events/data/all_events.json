Despite great promise, we have yet to harness the high-resolution information on cell states and fates that single-cell genomics data offer to understand cell fate decisions. Nor do we know in most cases how these decisions are controlled by gene regulatory networks. I will describe our recent work in constructing models of cell fate networks via the multiscale coupling of networks at two levels: cell-cell communication and of gene regulatory states. Through analysis of combination therapies for metastatic breast cancer, we have discovered new mechanisms by which modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment can improve patient outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam MacLean develops theory to understand cell fate decision-making in stem cells and cancer. He has developed models of cell-cell communication, and the gene regulatory networks that control cell fate decisions via single-cell multi-omics data analysis and statistical inference. He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, at the University of Southern California. He studied mathematical physics (BSc) at the University of Edinburgh, and completed a PhD in systems biology from Imperial College London. He worked as a postdoc at the University of Oxford and the University of California Irvine, before joining USC in 2019. Recent awards for his work include an NSF CAREER award (2022) and an NIH R35 MIRA award (2022).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/242136046951151\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Contract Gaming and Revenue Allocation in Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-authors: Atul Gupta (University of Pennsylvania) and Ambar La Forgia (UC Berkeley)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Firms often exploit loopholes in government contracts to boost revenues. The welfare consequences of this behavior depend on how firms use the marginal windfall dollar, yet little evidence exists to guide policymakers. This paper studies how hospitals allocated over $3 billion obtained from gaming a Medicare payment loophole. The average gaming hospital increased both Medicare and total revenue by around 10%, implying large spillovers on other payers. Consistent with theories of organizational behavior, nonprofit hospitals deployed most of the windfall toward operating costs, while for-profits deducted the entire amount off their balance sheet, distributing a substantial portion to executives and shareholders. Accordingly, we detect modest reductions in mortality rates at nonprofits but no changes at for-profits. Our results imply that the consequences of such engineered windfalls vary substantially by hospital ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Sacarny&amp;#39;s research explores the relationship between health care payment policy, provider and patient decision-making, and clinical quality. Much of this work involves using randomized controlled trials to test interventions in the health care delivery system. His research on health care providers has studied the effects of behavioral interventions on overprescribing, the adoption of hospital documentation and coding practices, and the relationship between hospital clinical outcomes and market share.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The neoliberal era is coming to an end, but what will replace it? Developing a coherent alternative will require fresh thinking that spans philosophy, economics and political science.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This timely conversation hosted by the &lt;a href=\"https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/our-work/center-political-economy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Political Economy&lt;/a&gt; will bring together a panel of scholars to explore the ideas that could shape a new economic paradigm. In his new book &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/book\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free and Equal: A Manifesto for a Just Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, economist and philosopher Daniel Chandler looks to the ideas of political philosopher John Rawls to reinvigorate liberalism and develop a new model of capitalism that would genuinely work for all. But is Rawls the thinker we need right now? What would a truly just economy look like? And how could we bring it about?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our panel will include &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Chandler&lt;/a&gt; (London School of Economics), &lt;a href=\"https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/daniel-luban\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Luban&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) and &lt;a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/alex-raskolnikov\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alex Raskolnikov&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia). &lt;a href=\"https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/communities-connections/faculty/suresh-naidu\"&gt;Suresh Naidu&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) will chair and moderate the discussion.&amp;nbsp;This program is brought to you in partnership with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/socialenterprise\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tamer Institute for Social Enterprise and Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This panel will take place in the Foyer&amp;nbsp;on the second floor of the Forum.

And a key focus in pursuit of that goal is advancing its science and technological abilities. China has made impressive advancements in the last 5-10 years in scientific research, and the technological content of the products it exports around the world, including to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Series will explore the current and near-term status of Chinese technological abilities and the continuing impacts this will have on the U.S. economy and military capabilities. Presentations by distinguished speakers are followed by ample time for questions and discussion. The social hour and dinner provide additional opportunities to meet the speakers, renew acquaintances, or join in stimulating discussions with other participants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each session begins at 6:15 PM on the second floor of Maggiano&amp;rsquo;s with a cash bar, followed by dinner at 7:00 PM, and the presentation from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The registration fee for the Series is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;$275 for ColumbiaDC members&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes all dinners.

This is a new opportunity and space is limited. &lt;strong&gt;A registration link will be shared with all participants in the Essentials series this term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this Practice Teaching session, CTL will pair you with a trained peer facilitator and a group of about 3 other graduate students in the Essentials series. Together, you and your fellow participants will take turns delivering short (&amp;lt;7 min.) samples of instruction to each other and practice putting into action the concepts and strategies discussed in the Essentials series. After each teaching sample, your facilitator and your peers will offer structured feedback to support your teaching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new offering is an opportunity&amp;nbsp;to try out the application of an approach or technique learned during the Essentials series. Participation in this Practice Teaching session is also a great way to make some quick headway on the CTL&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://tdp.ctl.columbia.edu/\"&gt;Teaching Development Program (TDP)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as this session satisfies the Application and Practice requirement of the Foundational Track.

Contrary to this common view, emotion and affect are integral to the development of comparative law, particularly through the lens of the US-China relationship, which can be characterized as &amp;quot;adversarial comparativism.&amp;quot; Rather than using law to emulate or learn from one another, the US and China engage in legal strategies aimed at outmaneuvering each other. This dynamic is evident in China&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of US-style extraterritoriality and the development of China-related property regimes by US state governments. These examples of adversarial comparativism illustrate how emotion drives legal frameworks in the context of a US-China rivalry, offering insight into the increasingly fragmented landscape of international law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is organized by the &lt;a href=\"https://chinese-legal-studies.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hong Yen Chang Center for Chinese Legal Studies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and co-sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"https://parker-school.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Parker School of Foreign &amp;amp; Comparative Law &lt;/a&gt;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.jtl.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Columbia Journal of Transnational Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew S.

However, most of the new historiographers adopt a restricted Americo-Eurocentric Perspective that disregards events and peoples in the rest of the world as makers of human rights history. For many in the Global South, the Western &amp;quot;rediscovery&amp;quot; of human rights in the 1970s looks more like retrenchment and repossession, part of a larger &amp;quot;rollback&amp;quot; on Third World agendas to decolonize and reshape the international order. This same period also saw an increased use of airline hijackings as a tactic of national liberation movements, which helped to speed a reversal in the official discourse on &amp;quot;terrorism.&amp;quot; Together, these forces facilitated a neoliberal hijacking of human rights that delegitimized national self-determination, narrowed international concern to the plight of individual political prisoners, and realigned the moral economy of human rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This series offers student-led conversations on human rights and social justice issues, examined through the work of ISHR faculty. Participants are asked to read the research in advance.&amp;nbsp;Light lunch will be served.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Registration is required for this event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Philosophy Hall Room 302&lt;/p&gt;",

The monthly seminars take place on the second Wednesday of the month, 2:00-3:00 PM EST. The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, October 9th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Carlos Carmona-Fontaine, Associate Professor of Biology, New York University. Seminar hosted by Simon Tavar&amp;eacute;. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus). If you wish to attend the seminar remotely, please register using the following link: &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0td-6qrz0qG9Bq0heUQR-6XAZoC7ZkfE_6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0td-6qrz0qG9Bq0heUQR-6XAZoC7ZkfE_6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title: &lt;/strong&gt;Modeling Social Cell Struggles in Cancer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Tumor evolution is shaped by cell competition and cooperation. While competition in cancer is widely studied, the role of cell cooperation and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their size falls below a critical tipping point. I will present our recent work where we sought to identify cooperative mechanisms in cancer so that we can exploit them and drive tumor populations to this critical point. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyzes these peptides, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperation to scavenge nutrients is key to survive in the tumor microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability. I will also present additional mathematical and experimental models showing how we can use insights from ecology to better understand the tumor&lt;br /&gt;\nmicroenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Carlos Carmona-Fontaine is an Associate Professor of Biology and member of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. He holds a PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology from University College London, UK and a BSc in Biological Sciences from Chile. The main interest of his laboratory is to understand how cells organize to form multicellular structures and to coordinate in collective processes. Multicellular is important during physiological processes such as embryonic development but it is also critical in cancer and other diseases. The work of his lab suggests that a large part of this organization emerges from social and ecological interactions between cells that are mediated by metabolites &amp;ndash; nutrients and waste products of cellular activity. Prior to joining the faculty at NYU, Carlos was an independent research fellow at the Computational Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He received a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award during his postdoctoral research and was awarded the Beddington Medal for his doctoral studies. As faculty member he received a number of grants including a DP2 New Innovator Award from the NIH, a Pew Biomedical Fellowship, and an American Cancer Society research fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

In the United States, one in three babies is born via C-section, a rate that has grown exponentially over the past fifty years. While in most cases the procedure is safe, it is not without significant, sometimes life-changing consequences, many of which affect people of color disproportionately. Invisible Labor lifts the veil on C-sections so that people can make choices about pregnancy and surgical birth with greater knowledge of the risks, benefits, and alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rachel Somerstein will be in conversation with Dr. Christopher Travis, MD, MS, an alumnx of the Columbia Narrative Medicine masters program and Assistant Professor and Assistant Education Director for Narrative Medicine in the Department of OB/GYN at University Hospitals/Case Western Reserve University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Romantic period&amp;#39;s upheaval cast both traditional communal organizations of life and outgrowths of the new revolutionary age into crisis. In this context, Joseph Albernaz argues that Romantic writers articulate a vital conception of &amp;quot;groundless community,&amp;quot; while following this idea through its aesthetic, ecological, political, and philosophical registers into the present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst the violent expropriation of the commons, Romantic writers including the Wordsworths, Clare, H&amp;ouml;lderlin, and the revolutionary abolitionist Robert Wedderburn reimagined the forms of their own lives through literature to conceive community as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;groundless&lt;/em&gt;, a disposition toward radically open forms of sharing&amp;mdash;including with nonhuman beings&amp;mdash;without recourse to any collective identity. Both a poetics and ethics, groundless community names an everyday sociality that surges beneath and against the enclosures of property and identity, binding us to the movements of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unearthing Romanticism&amp;#39;s intersections with the history of communism and the general strike, Albernaz also demonstrates how Romantic literature&amp;#39;s communal imagination reverberates through later theories of community in Bataille, Derrida, Nancy, Moten, and others. With sharp close readings, new historical constellations, and innovative theoretical paradigms,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Common Measures&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;recasts the relationship of the Romantic period to the basic terms of modernity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/joseph-albernaz\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Joseph Albernaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. He specializes in the literature, especially poetry, of the Romantic period, with a particular interest in the legacies of Romanticism across a number of theoretical and critical domains. His first book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Common Measures: Romanticism and the Groundlessness of Community&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Stanford University Press, 2024), reads writers from Geneva to Jamaica to trace new formations of community, ecology, and the every day in Romantic literature and its later inheritors. Broadly speaking, his recent work seeks to place close and comparative literary analysis in convergent dialogue with philosophical inquiry and with historical trajectories of insurgency and revolt. He is currently working on a second book, tentatively entitled &amp;quot;The Time Torn Remnant of the Holiday,&amp;quot; on calendars, festivals, work, temporality, and rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for in-person &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrating-recent-work-by-joseph-albernaz-tickets-1001528527787?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for Zoom &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_WXr-XYsGT6SqUReaVw_Jpg#/registration\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Born into precarious freedom after the American Revolution and reaching adulthood in the lead-up to the Civil War, this remarkable generation ultimately played an outsized role in political and legal conflicts over slavery&amp;rsquo;s future, influencing both the nation&amp;rsquo;s path to the Civil War and changes to the US Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The Rising Generation&lt;/em&gt; shows how, as the children of gradual abolition reached adulthood, they took the lessons of their youth into midcentury campaigns for legal equality, political inclusion, equitable common school education, and the expansion of freedom across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;",

The risks of fiscal crisis and/or hyperinflation are increasing.

In the 1930s,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralistas&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;envisioned creating what they called a Christian holistic state (&lt;em&gt;Estado Integral&lt;/em&gt;), in which corporatism, nationalism, and faith would sustain the country&amp;rsquo;s very existence in opposition to communism, materialism, and liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Offering a fresh analytical framework to this history, Traldi argues that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralistas&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;were able to meaningfully re-group after the Era of Fascism, and that women emerged as key socio-political agents for the &amp;ldquo;reinvention&amp;rdquo; of Brazilian Integralismo from Latin America&amp;rsquo;s largest fascist movement of the 1930s to an influential far-right Christian nationalist group after the mid-1940s. Drawing from largely unexplored sources, such as correspondence, iconographic material, private collections, and oral histories, and building from important scholarship of Latin America, Traldi shows how gender, fascism, and religion appeared as intertwined, complex categories of analysis especially during the Cold War in Latin America. Also, her talk raises an alarm in the present: the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralista&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;recipe of God, Fatherland, Family lasted much longer than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/god-fatherland-family-integralismo-and-the-far-right-in-brazil-tickets-1001456903557?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Edward Nunes and Aimee Campbell, who have run studies testing therapeutic apps, will engage Dr. Marsch in a discussion providing an overview of the landscape of technology and substance/mental health treatment, and engage the audience to brainstorm on potential future directions and projects.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The final years of the Third Reich witnessed the rise of a radical strain of chronopolitical discourse suggesting that a German defeat would spell the very end of history. History had only come into being under Hitler and it would perish with him. Ultimately, the war was a gigantic fireworks display in which a fatally accelerated &amp;quot;time without precedent&amp;quot; (Goebbels) was using up all its historical energy. This radical strain was there from the beginning of Nazism and survived its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The talk will analyze its peculiar logic by tracing and connecting several manifestations: the notion of terminal performance underlying the widespread abuse of the methamphetamine Pervitin; the idea of compressed morbidity guiding the future plans of Nazi insurance agencies to advocate a policy of senicide; the early literary prefiguration of the monopolization of history by the Third Reich in Katharine Burdekin&amp;#39;s 1937 dystopia Swastika Night; Hans Blumenberg&amp;#39;s philosophical take on Hitler&amp;#39;s final days; and, most importantly, the post-Stalingrad rhetoric of Joseph Goebbels, who in the wake of Hitler&amp;#39;s increasing absence becomes the principal purveyor of the Nazi chronobscene.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geoffrey Winthrop-Young&lt;/strong&gt; (MA Freiburg, PhD UBC) is Professor of German and Nordic Studies at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* Reception to follow&lt;/p&gt;",

In her work, Tabassum seeks to establish a language of architecture that is contemporary yet reflectively rooted to place, always against an ecological rubric containing climate, context, culture, history. Her project the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque in Bangladesh is distinguished by its lack of popular mosque iconography, its emphasis on space and light, and its capacity to function not only as a place of worship but also as a refuge for a dense neighborhood on Dhaka&amp;rsquo;s periphery. The portfolio of work notwithstanding, Tabassum&amp;rsquo;s practice remains consciously contained in size, undertaking a limited number of projects per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tabassum is a Professor at Technical University Delft, in the Netherlands. She held the Gehry Chair at the University of Toronto 2022 - 2023. She has taught in Harvard University Graduate School of Design, University of Texas, Bengal Institute and BRAC University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She received an Honorary Doctorate from Technical University of Munich. In addition to Aga Khan Awards for Architecture, she has received many accolades including Arnold Brunner Memorial Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Gold Medal of the French Academy of Architecture and Soane medal in Architecture from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tabassum chairs Foundation for Architecture and Community Equity (F.A.C.E) and Prokritee, a Fare trade organization. She has served as the member of the Steering Committee of the Aga Khan Awards for Architecture from 2017 to 2022. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event content is equivalent to 1.5 AIA/CES total learning credit.

Anooradha&amp;rsquo;s talk will be followed by a response from&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nora Akawi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Cooper Union) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mabel Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;(GSAPP, AAADS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Environments associated with migration are often seen as provisional, lacking both history and architecture. As Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi demonstrates in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration&lt;/em&gt;, a refugee camp&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic and material landscapes&amp;mdash;even if born out of emergency&amp;mdash;reveal histories, futures, politics, and rhetorics. She identifies forces of colonial and humanitarian settlement, tracing spatial and racial politics in the Dadaab refugee camps established in 1991 on the Kenya-Somalia border&amp;mdash;at once a dense setting that manifests decades of architectural, planning, and design initiatives and a much older constructed environment that reflects its own ways of knowing. She moves beyond ahistorical representations of camps and their inhabitants by constructing a material and visual archive of Dadaab, finding long migratory traditions in the architecture, spatial practices, landscapes, and iconography of refugees and humanitarians. Countering conceptualizations of refugee camps as sites of border transgression, criminality, and placelessness, Siddiqi instead theorizes them as complex settlements, ecologies, and material archives created through histories of partition, sedentarization, domesticity, and migration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/3272/Architecture-of-MigrationThe-Dadaab-Refugee-Camps\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Learn more about&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration: The Dadaab Refugee Camps and Humanitarian Settlement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an architectural historian at Barnard College, Columbia University, and author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration: The Dadaab Refugee Camps and Humanitarian Settlement&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Duke University Press), on the spatial politics, ecologies, iconography, visual rhetoric, and long colonial traditions of the UNHCR-administered camps at Dadaab, Kenya. She is the author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minnette De Silva: Intersections&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Mack Books), and her book manuscript&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ecologies of the Past: The Inhabitations and Designs of Anil and Minnette de Silva&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;analyzes the politics of heritage environments through the work of Sri Lankan architect Minnette de Silva and art historian Anil de Silva-Vigier.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Friday 10/18, 1:10pm&amp;ndash;2:25pm, is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb70-9192dd15-0191-9547e0d4-00005197events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Gorelick shows how modern concepts of literature and the unconscious were generated in response to these efforts and by an ethical concern for what the language of the Enlightenment excludes, represses, or struggles to erase. Troubling the idea of the Enlightenment on its own terms, subverting its supposed authority from within, Gorelick thus reveals the workings of unconscious fantasy at the foundations of our contemporary political realities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Unwritten Enlightenment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;makes clear that to criticize the Enlightenment&amp;rsquo;s deficiencies, ambiguities, and legacies of violence without regard for the unconscious fantasies that drive them risks reproducing the very patterns of thought, action, and imagination that the Enlightenment novel already unsettles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.barnard.edu/profiles/nathan-gorelick\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nathan Gorelick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;teaches in the English Department and for the First-Year Experience program at Barnard College.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This year, despite vociferous internal protest, the Subcommission on Quarternary Stratigraphy denied the existence of an Anthropocene epoch as a formal unit of the Geological Time Scale, opting for the looser geological concept of an &amp;ldquo;episode&amp;rdquo;. What began with a bang ended with a whimper&amp;mdash;this was an inauspicious end to a period where so much ink has been spent on a geological concept in the social sciences and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or was it not an ending at all? While geology has formalized timekeeping procedures, the life of a concept in critical scholarship tends to be irresolute, more valued for the questions it raises than the matters it puts to rest. In the name of the Anthropocene, renewed attention to capitalism&amp;rsquo;s terraforming force emerged. New approaches to the multiple temporalities of history and more-than-human assemblages have been devised; new anthropogenic ecologies have been imagined; the boundaries between life and nonlife have become critical problematics. The traffic between earth science and social and humanities scholarship went in several directions. In selecting a &amp;ldquo;golden spike&amp;rdquo; for the Anthropocene, geologists trying to extract a sediment core from a Canadian lake were embroiled in controversies over Indigenous cosmologies and land stewardship, settler colonization, and nuclear fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles, this panel conducts a post-mortem inquiry for the Anthropocene. Does the geological rejection of the term matter for how humanists should think about relations between the social and the planetary? What did the Anthropocene debacle reveal about epistemic power relations? And where to go now?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/leah-aronowsky\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leah Aronowsky&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Climate at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/elizabeth-povinelli\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elizabeth Povinelli&lt;/a&gt;, Franz Boas Professor of Anthropology and Gender Studies at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/shr7208.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sophia Roosth&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at New York University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-post-mortem-for-the-anthropocene-registration-976730425997\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/valentina-izmirlieva/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scholars of empire have long argued that imperial states frequently borrowed technologies and techniques of governance from each other, often without acknowledging their sources. Others have noted that pre-modern empires did not observe a secular separation of church and state; instead, one invariably finds a complex entanglement of religious and state institutions. This talk seeks to explore the intersection of these two claims in the borderlands of the Russian empire and the Qing empire, as well as those of their respective successors. Through a series of cases from the early modern to contemporary, it seeks to show how representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church selectively adopted political strategies and semiotic forms from other Christian and non-Christian religious traditions through processes of inter-imperial contact and competition. In the course of discussing these cases, the talk will also seek to highlight the role of ostensibly secular state officials in catalyzing these moments of cultural transfer.&lt;/p&gt;",

Du Bois cited informal, Black-led free schools as the most radical innovation of Reconstruction and perhaps its greatest loss as they were institutionalized by its end. This talk tells a new story about the expansion of higher education in the United States, one centered on the struggle for control over schools founded by the formerly enslaved between these communities, the state-run Freedman&amp;rsquo;s Bureau, missionary organizations, and philanthropic foundations. This talk will argue that building campaigns and the negotiation and management of funding, lands, labor, and form reveal the unsettled status of the Black college from an instrument of liberation to one of social control. Beginning with the foundation and early development of the Hampton Institute, which foregrounded education as part of the project of reparations, the talk will build from the legal concept of abandonment as a precondition for new possession to the centrality of land claims, settlement, and separatism in the development of a second campus, the Tuskegee Institute, led by Hampton graduate Booker T.

Since before the passage of CHIPS and Science Act in summer 2022, federal and state governments, companies and universities have stepped up the effort to revitalize the entire semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. We will review Purdue University&amp;rsquo;s initiatives in this area and draw some lessons on universities&amp;rsquo; role in talent development, research moonshots, and public private partnership.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOGRAPHY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMung Chiang is the 13th president of Purdue University and the Roscoe H. George Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He was previously the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering and executive vice president for strategic initiatives at Purdue University, as well as the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chiang founded the Princeton EDGE Lab in 2009 and then founded several startup companies and industry consortia in edge computing. As the Science and Technology Adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State in 2020, he initiated tech diplomacy programs for the U.S. government. Currently he serves on the inaugural board of the U.S. Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation and several corporate and nonprofit boards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chiang received his BS (1999), MS (2000) and PhD (2003) from Stanford University and an honorary doctorate (2024) from Dartmouth College. For his research in communication networks, he received the NSF Alan T. Waterman Award (2013), as well as the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award (2012), the IEEE INFOCOM Achievement Award (2022) and a Guggenheim Fellowship (2014). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences 2024), the National Academy of Inventors (2020) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;On October 18, 2024, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University will convene scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and activists for a symposium about surveillance and censorship and the changing role of the international border.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. government uses its authority over the border to justify the surveillance of social media, the interrogation of travelers about their political and religious views, the warrantless search of travelers&amp;rsquo; laptops and cellphones, the imposition of limits on Americans&amp;rsquo; right to engage with foreign speakers and to access foreign communications platforms, and the suspension of the constitutional rules that would ordinarily apply to the surveillance of Americans&amp;rsquo; emails and telephone calls. Panelists will consider these practices and their implications from a range of perspectives, including theoretical, doctrinal, historical, and empirical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Regardless of Frontiers&amp;rdquo; will also feature a photo exhibition entitled &amp;ldquo;Infrastructures of Control,&amp;rdquo; by&amp;nbsp;Colter Thomas&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Dugan Meyer. Through a series of photographs, the exhibit aims to create a visual archive of security and surveillance infrastructure in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. An opening reception will be held on the evening of October 17 at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will take place at Columbia University and online.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The economic activities of a company can exacerbate the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land and sea use change, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. Direct drivers have impacts on species and ecosystems while affecting people who rely on ecosystem services for their livelihood. In addition, the majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest companies have a significant dependency on nature across their direct operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conversations about biodiversity have focused on ecological conservation efforts, habitat restoration, and on-the-ground fieldwork in specific locations. In recent years, biodiversity reporting frameworks that attempt to capture the total financial impact and dependency of individual corporations have begun to emerge. Frameworks such as TNFD, GRI 101, and ESRS E4 will shape corporate disclosure on how issuers impact and rely on biodiversity, illuminating the financial risks related to this dependence, and highlighting steps companies can and should take to mitigate their impact on biodiversity loss. Dr. Satyajit Bose, Associate Director of the Climate School&amp;rsquo;s Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management and Professor of Professional Practice at SPS, will interview a panel of ecology, biodiversity, financial, and corporate disclosure experts about the challenges and potential for corporate management of natural capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome Remarks: Dr. Steven Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; is the Director of the Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management at Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Climate School.

Medicine, Chaplains, and Healing the Whole Person&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The modern world faces religious, spiritual and existential quandaries, as new technologies redefine the beginnings and ends of life. Excruciating choices arise about when to turn off the machines&amp;mdash;whether and when we should &amp;quot;play God.&amp;quot; The COVID-19 pandemic made these dilemmas ever more acute. Increasingly, however, public discourse on religion and spirituality is polarized, with evangelicals on one side and vehement atheists on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book explores how patients and families struggle to make sense of serious disease and threats of death and other medical crises, seeking hope, purpose and larger connections beyond themselves. Physicians and other clinical staff are frequently uncomfortable with these issues, and chaplains have been filling the void, developing valuable approaches and insights. Most Americans will live out their final years in hospitals or nursing homes, and face existential and spiritual quandaries. Many of their prior religious and spiritual beliefs will fall short, and chaplains will often be the ones to assist, partly by reframing narratives and understandings of illness and spirituality. Yet people often know little, if anything, about these professionals. Klitzman presents stories about the spiritual lives of patients and explores the role of chaplains&amp;mdash;who they are, what they do and the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drawing on in-depth interviews and the author&amp;#39;s personal experiences, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor, Will You Pray for Me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides vital information that can assist in medical care decisions. Dr. Klitzman argues that a better understanding of the relationship between these realms will enable more holistic and humane treatment of patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1001512941167?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Klitzman, M.D., Program Director, Bioethics; Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Athina Fontenot (af3018@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

These essential characteristics of intelligent behavior are still beyond the capabilities of today&amp;#39;s most powerful AI architectures, such as Auto-Regressive LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will present a cognitive architecture that may constitute a path towards human-level AI. The centerpiece of the architecture is a predictive world model that allows the system to predict the consequences of its actions. and to plan sequences of actions that that fulfill a set of objectives. The objectives may include guardrails that guarantee the system&amp;#39;s controllability and safety. The world model employs a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) trained with self-supervised learning, largely by observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The JEPA simultaneously learns an encoder, that extracts maximally-informative representations of the percepts, and a predictor that predicts the representation of the next percept from the representation of the current percept and an optional action variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We show that JEPAs trained on images and videos produce good representations for image and video understanding. We show that they can detect unphysical events in videos. Finally, we show that planning can be performed by searching for action sequences that produce predicted end state that match a given target state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTINGUISHED LECTURER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yann LeCun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;VP &amp;amp; Chief AI Scientist, Meta;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor, NYU; ACM Turing Award Laureate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yann LeCun is VP &amp;amp; Chief AI Scientist at Meta and a Professor at NYU.

Selective leg joint control is the ability to move the leg joints in isolation and is mediated by the corticospinal tracts. Dr. Sargent will discuss the developmental trajectory of selective leg joint control in infants with spastic cerebral palsy to inform its use as an early biomarker of spastic cerebral palsy. In addition, she will discuss early activities that can be used to promote selective motor control during infancy, when selective leg joint control is emerging in typical development and when there is the greatest potential for neuroplastic change to maximize lifelong motor function.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Barbara Sargent, PhD, PT is an associate professor of clinical physical therapy.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 1&amp;nbsp;on Friday 10/11, 1:10pm&amp;ndash;2:25pm, is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb70-9192dd15-0191-95451d09-000050d8events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

We will explore questions such as, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Do plate-scale processes impact island arc exhumation&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How does a continent break up and seafloor spreading start when there is barely any magmatism?; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we know the total offset on a strike-slip boundary?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Emily H.

Instead, Weaver promotes interpolation as the signature form of medieval British historiography and a vehicle of historical theory, arguing that some of the most novel concepts of time in medieval historiography can be found in these altered narratives of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Weaver, historiographical interpolation constitutes the traces of active experimentation with how best to write history, particularly the history of Britain. Historians in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Britain recognized the difficulty of enfolding complex events into a linear chronology and embraced innovative textual methods of creating history. Focusing on the Brut tradition but also analyzing the long history of interpolated historiography, including the Bayeux Embroidery,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Histories&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;offers a new interpretation of generic remixing in medieval writing about the past. Drawing on both manuscript studies and the new formalism, it shows that the practice of inserting materials from romance and hagiography allowed creative revisers to explore how lived events relate to passing time. By embracing interpolation, Weaver provides lively insights into the ways that time becomes history and human actors experience time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/hannah-m-weaver\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hannah Weaver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. She teaches and writes about the literature of medieval Europe, particularly the regions now known as England and France. Her first monograph,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Histories: Interpolation and the Medieval British Past&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(Cornell, 2024), argues that interpolation is the signature form of medieval British historiography and a vehicle of historical theory. Her articles about everything from time in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the treachery of incomprehensible English to the relationship of genre to purgatory have appeared or are forthcoming in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ELH, New Literary History, New Medieval Literatures, JMEMS&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Viator&lt;/em&gt;, among other venues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CU/BC ID holders, register below.

She is a Professor at Columbia GSAPP and Director of the Urban Design Program, where she coordinates complex interdisciplinary studios centered on urban systems of the future. Her design studios and seminars aim to discover new ways of integrating social life, infrastructure, urban form, biodiversity and community-based change. She was awarded a 2017 MacArthur Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Orff is a registered landscape architect and the founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.scapestudio.com/\"&gt;SCAPE&lt;/a&gt;, an award winning 70-person professional practice based in lower Manhattan, where she directs the design of all projects. The firm has won National and local American Society of Landscape Architecture Awards for built projects, planning and communications work, and the work of the office has been featured on the cover of Landscape Architecture magazine, LA China and Topos, and in The New York Times, New Yorker and Economist, among other publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Professor at Columbia and as a practicing professional, she has advanced concepts of sustainable planning and urban design at multiple scales. Orff recently contributed the essay &amp;ldquo;Mending the Landscape&amp;rdquo; to the publication&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;All We Can Save&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(One World, 2020). Her book and traveling exhibit with Richard Misrach titled&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;PETROCHEMICAL AMERICA&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Aperture Foundation, 2012) draws a cognitive map of climate change causes and effects and anticipates future planning challenges for the American landscape. Featuring photographs by Misrach, the book links the lived experience of communities, degraded extraction landscapes and public health issues in the lower Mississippi to national patterns of resource consumption and global waste. In the New York region, SCAPE&amp;rsquo;s Living Breakwaters project was awarded $60 million in CDBG-DR funding by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as part of the Rebuild by Design Initiative. This joint physical-social project in Raritan Bay helps protect Staten Island from future storms, enhances maritime ecosystems and connects residents and students to the shoreline via the Billion Oysters Project curriculum. This project also won the 2014 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, &amp;ldquo;socially responsible design&amp;rsquo;s highest award.&amp;rdquo; It projects a holistic view of human ecology as a path forward and represents a continuum of work that began with the Jamaica Bay study in 2006 and was visualized in &amp;lsquo;Oyster-tecture&amp;rsquo; as part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rising Currents&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2010) exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and&amp;ndash;after Hurricanes Irene and Sandy&amp;ndash;helped shape the debate on how to adapt and retool urban contexts relative to climate dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kate Orff received an Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, reserved for American artists and design practitioners &amp;ldquo;whose work is characterized by a strong personal direction&amp;rdquo; and was named a 2017 MacArthur Foundation &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; Fellow. She was named a United States Artist Fellow, and an Elle magazine &amp;ldquo;Planet Fixer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event content is equivalent to 1.5 AIA/CES total learning credit.

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;IN-PERSON REGISTRATION IS CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;.

What they rarely consider is that, like that of any other nation, America&amp;rsquo;s DNA differs from that of their country. It may take a lifetime to adjust to the unfamiliar country&amp;rsquo;s culture, mentality, and way of doing many things differently from the way they have known. It is especially true when immigrants come to America from a country based on different principles, in this case, collectivist Russia versus individualist America, with opposing political systems&amp;mdash;the democratic American one and the totalitarian Soviet. A sequel to the author&amp;rsquo;s autobiographical trilogy&amp;mdash;Shush! Growing up Jewish under Stalin, In the Jaws of the Crocodile, and Farewell, Mama Odessa&amp;mdash;this book is part mem&amp;shy;oir and part cultural study about the challenges of immigration and American acculturation. With self-deprecating humor, the author, a former Soviet satirist who was punished for trespassing the boundaries of public criticism, recollects his growing pains as he overcame his indoctrinated upbringing in a totalitarian society to embrace America&amp;rsquo;s defining values.&lt;/p&gt;",

Wealth managers must weigh the pros and cons of specialization while keeping an eye on emerging markets and evolving client needs.

In this talk, I explore the&amp;nbsp;drivers of the retirement boom and its unexpected persistence. In the first part, I present findings covering the initial year of the pandemic. Using large-scale public survey data to explore patterns in employment and retirement transitions among older adults, I find that retirement transitions increased broadly across demographic groups but concentrated at the high and low ends of the earnings distribution. Job characteristics that best predicted increased pandemic retirement transitions were employment in high-contact occupations and part-time work schedules. In the second part of the talk, I zoom out to explore the persistence of the pandemic retirement boom in the years since 2020. Using approaches from machine learning to project counterfactual retirement trends, I provide current estimates for the number of excess retirees in the U.S. population and the demographic breakdown of this group. Finally, I discuss the implications for retirement policy, older adults&amp;#39; welfare, and economic theories about retirement behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Traditionally, they have been analyzed using compartmental models (Bass, SI, ...), which implicitly assume that all the individuals are homogeneous and connected to each other. To relax these assumptions, research has gradually shifted to the more fundamental network models, which are particle models for the stochastic adoption/infection by each individual. In this talk I will present an emerging mathematical theory for the Bass and SI models on networks. I will present analytic tools that enable us to obtain explicit expressions for the&amp;nbsp; expected adoption/infection level on various networks (complete, circular, d-regular, Erdos- Renyi, ...), without employing mean-field type approximations. The main focus of the talk will be&amp;nbsp; on the effect of network structure. For example, which networks yield the slowest and fastest spreading? What is the effect of boundaries? Of heterogeneity among individuals? How does the network structure influence the optimal promotional strategy?&lt;/p&gt;",

As more stakeholders and policy makers look to make decisions based on such data, there is an increasing drive for standardization, automation, harmonization, accountability and compliance.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut the data alone will not solve climate change &amp;ndash; people from all job functions are critical to unlocking the learnings, innovations and opportunities that can rapidly decarbonize our systems and supply chains. Professionals from a variety of job functions, working within all major institutions, are taking the initiatives to transform their businesses, making the case for strategic investments, integrating expectations into purchasing contracts, setting benchmarks for regulatory compliance, and innovating new climate-resilient materials and systems.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nClimate change demands that we drive action at a speed commensurate with the challenges we are rapidly learning to quantify.

Do these questions play out differently in France and the United States and what we learn from these differences?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have invited a panel of leading journalists and thinkers to share their reflections on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louis Dreyfus&lt;/strong&gt; is Managing Director of French media group &lt;em&gt;Le Monde.&lt;/em&gt; A graduate from the HEC Business School and an alumnus of the London School of Economics, Louis Dreyfus is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Group &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, the leading independent French media group with numerous publications such as &lt;a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.lemonde.fr_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=009klHSCxuh5AI1vNQzSO0KGjl4nbi2Q0M1QLJX9BeE&amp;amp;r=UOaT3EI62dDv2Mf-nAtTTR3t3XQsaJ8H6Je3ArrKCqs&amp;amp;m=qgHzTJYFcpt1KuY4AiA-yE_Sqx3LC46-_jfiNAoGlyuwY6ukVgogAMaycrBsscqn&amp;amp;s=AQRy0BR89L3RI-NUXnbVePqM1pu9atDkXMNUekqIneY&amp;amp;e=\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; l&amp;rsquo;Obs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;T&amp;eacute;l&amp;eacute;rama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Courrier International&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La Vie&lt;/em&gt;, le &lt;em&gt;Monde Diplomatique&lt;/em&gt; and several digital pure players such as the French edition of &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;.

Departing from leading theoretical accounts which present the courts and legislature as rivals for constitutional supremacy, Kavanagh argues that protecting rights is a collaborative enterprise between all three branches of government - the Executive, the legislature, and the courts. On a collaborative vision of constitutionalism, protecting rights is neither the solitary task of a Herculean super-judge, nor the dignified pronouncements of an enlightened legislature. Instead, it is a complex, dynamic, and collaborative endeavour, where each branch has a distinct but complementary role to play, whilst engaging with each other in a spirit of comity and mutual respect. Connecting constitutional theory with the practice of protecting rights in a democracy, this book offers an innovative understanding of the separation of powers, grounded in the values and virtues of constitutional collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTLgrads Learning Community - Bridging the Divide: Interdisciplinary Teaching and Its Pedagogical Effects (Session 1) - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;for graduate students&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the effects of &amp;ldquo;disciplining&amp;rdquo; knowledge and how might an interdisciplinary approach to developing syllabi enrich pedagogical practice and student learning in the classroom? This two-part LC will consider these questions and the effect of interdisciplinary teaching more broadly. Among the goals of this LC is to consider the benefits of constructing a unified academy and what effect interdisciplinarity has on our students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Graduate student instructors at Columbia encounter students of every major and academic background, particularly in courses taught as part of the core curriculum and language instruction. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching is a valuable method by which to engage students across academic interests. It also supports students&amp;rsquo; learning across disciplines, highlights&amp;nbsp;how knowledge interconnects between academic departments, and encourages students to pursue their own interdisciplinary approach to learning. This LC is intended for participants from all academic disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and will be co-facilitated by Marissa Swan and Emma Leidy, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Wednesday 10/30, 2:10pm&amp;ndash;3:25pm, is available &lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb7c-91bc1926-0191-bdd6412d-00003ca7events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each session of this LC counts as a Pedagogy Workshop for the &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/ctl-tdp\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching Development Program (TDP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Within a few short years, she became famous: she was read and debated from Russia to Prussia, from Switzerland to England, from up north in Sweden to down south in Italy. This was not just remarkable because she was a woman, but because of the substance of her contributions. While the men in her milieu like Voltaire and Kant sought disciples to promote their ideas, Du Ch&amp;acirc;telet promoted intellectual autonomy. She counselled her readers to read the classics, but never to become a follower of another&amp;#39;s ideas. Her proclamation that a true philosopher must remain an independent thinker, rather than a disciple of some supposedly &amp;ldquo;great man&amp;rdquo; like Isaac Newton or Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes, posed a threat to an emerging consensus in the Enlightenment. And that made her dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rew Janiak&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor of Philosophy and co-leader of Project Vox at Duke University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christia Mercer&lt;/strong&gt; is Gustave M.

In an era of conflict, crisis, disinformation and fragmentation, public health is more challenging - and more urgent - than ever. 2024-25&amp;rsquo;s Grand Rounds will look at the role of public health in current affairs, and the way current affairs are impacting public health. Together we&amp;rsquo;ll engage in discussions about today&amp;rsquo;s greatest public health challenges, how to learn across differences, potential compromises and solutions, and apply an interdisciplinary lens to understand how some of the biggest debates of the moment are shaping the sector. From themes like the political determinants of health, understanding the toll of inequality on the health of people, and the health consequences of war and crisis, Grand Rounds will focus on threats to public health today as well as what we need to address them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nGrand Rounds was initiated in 2008 at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health to create an intellectual space within which to explore national and global public health challenges and the innovative approaches needed to transform the public&amp;rsquo;s health in the 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We value inclusion and access for all participants and are pleased to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

Following the hard-won recognitions of gay and lesbian victims of the Holocaust and in the maelstrom of contemporary global attacks on trans existence, scholarly and public investments in this history are at their apex&amp;mdash;provoking debates in the German Bundestag and libel cases. Yet the content of this history remains largely unknown. Using granular archival research, Zavier Nunn&amp;rsquo;s first book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trans Liminality and the Paranoid Past: Subjectivity and the State, Germany 1919-45&lt;/em&gt;, explores the micro and macro registers of how everyday trans life was experienced, policed, and cut short across the Weimar and Nazi regimes, sometimes in surprising&amp;mdash;but always uneven&amp;mdash;ways.

How, then, are leaders able to wage war in the face of popular opposition, or end conflicts when the public still supports them? This question is all the more salient as voters wrestle with U.S. support for conflicts abroad and prepare for the 2024 presidential election.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nElizabeth Saunders will help answer key questions surrounding the politics of war, sharing insights from her book &lt;em&gt;The Insiders&amp;rsquo; Game: How Elites Make War and Peace&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(linked &lt;a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691215815/the-insiders-game?srsltid=AfmBOoqEAQwXR6GP7SQp2uPCVpIw8z-9a-Qlw_9rWuQi6jWxRwMHX2XV\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

    "description": "The Light of Learning: Hasidism in Poland on the Eve of the HolocaustRobert Seltzer Lecture Series\nThe Light of Learning: Hasidism in Poland on the Eve of the Holocaust\nThe Light of Learning, by Glenn Dynner, tells the story of an unexpected Hasidic revival in Poland on the eve of the Holocaust. Hasidic leaders reinvented themselves through an ensuing pedagogical revolution. Hasidic yeshivas soon overshadowed courts and Hasidic leaders became known more for scholarship than miracle-working. By mobilizing Torah study, Hasidic leaders were able to subvert the \"civilizing\" projects of the Polish state, successfully rival Zionists and Socialists, and create clandestine yeshiva bunkers in ghettos during the Holocaust. Torah study was thus not only a spiritual-intellectual endeavor but a political practice that fueled a culture of resistance.\u00a0The Light of Learning\u00a0belies notions of late Hasidic decadence and decline and transforms our understanding of Polish Jewry during its final hour.\nPresented by: Dr. Glenn Dynner,\u00a0Carl and Dorothy Bennett Professor of Judaic Studies at Fairfield University, editor of the journal\u00a0Shofar: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies,\u00a0and a recent Guggenheim Fellow.\u00a0He is the author of\u00a0Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society\u00a0(OUP, 2006), and\u00a0Yankel's Tavern: Jews, Liquor, and Life in the Kingdom of Poland\u00a0(OUP, 2013).\u00a0\nThis lecture will be held online via Zoom.\u00a0\n\nZoom link will be provided upon\u00a0RSVP\nPlease download the Zoom app before joining the event\nAccess Hunter College's \"Zoom Webinars Best Practices\" Guide\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 8, 2024\nTime:\n2:30 PM \u2014 3:30 PM\nCollege:\nHunter College\nAddress:\nOnline\nPhone:\n212-772-4000\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://hunter.cuny.edu/event/the-light-of-learning-hasidism-in-poland-on-the-eve-of-the-holocaust/",

    "description": "Create a Unique Degree in CUNY With CUNY BA \u2013 Info SessionWHAT IS CUNY BACCALAUREATE (CUNY BA)?\nCUNY BA is an Interdisciplinary Studies program that works\u00a0within\u00a0the CUNY college system. It has been around for over\u00a0fifty years! CUNY BA is for students who want to design a bachelor\u2019s degree (Area of Concentration|AOC) that is not already offered in CUNY.\nWhile CUNY BA does guide students with requirements, the program does not tell students what to study. Students should know what areas they want to pursue. As part of the CUNY BA application,\u00a0students propose what they want to study\u00a0and what CUNY courses they think are suitable for the bachelor\u2019s degree they are creating (it\u2019s a first draft).\nCUNY BA students take courses in the CUNY departments and/or colleges to fulfill the AOC requirements. So, students will have to be enrolled in a CUNY college to be part of CUNY BA program (that will be the student\u2019s home college).\u00a0\u00a0Students will need to be accepted into a CUNY college for the\u00a0Spring 2025\u00a0semester.\nFor Example:\u00a0A student in CUNYBA would\u00a0not\u00a0create\u00a0an\u00a0Area of Concentration (AOC)\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0just\u00a0\"Computer Science\"\u00a0(since Computer Science is already offered as a traditional\u00a0major\u00a0in a CUNY college). Instead, they would\u00a0create a single AOC\u00a0named\u00a0\"Computer Science and\u00a0Cyber\u00a0Security\" or study two\u00a0disciplines separately and have two AOCs such as\nAOC\u00a01: Computer Science and\u00a0AOC\u00a02:\u00a0Cyber Security and Mathematics.\nThe student searches the CUNY catalogs for courses that are suitable for their Area of Concentration (AOC).\u00a0The courses listed in the AOC must be from\u00a0CUNY\u2019s four-year colleges\u00a0(not community colleges).\nThe CUNY BA info session discusses:\n\nHow CUNY BA works and the application criteria\nThe CUNY BA application process and requirements for creating the CUNY BA Area of Concentration (AOC).\nWhat a CUNY BA Faculty Mentor is\nWhere to search for CUNY courses for your CUNY BA Area of Concentration (AOC).\nOpportunities and pipeline programs within CUNY BA\nQuestion and Answer session\n\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 8, 2024\nTime:\n3:00 PM \u2014 4:00 PM\nCollege:\nCUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies\nAddress:\nONLINE\nPhone:\n2128178220\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://cunyba.cuny.edu/prospective-students/informationsessions/",

In this film screening and discussion series, we will process this flood of images by attending to a particularly influential period of their production: the 1950s to 1980s. This period saw the return of location filming to the city and the reconceptualization of dirt as grit. Over the course of the fall, we will watch and discuss six films that exemplify six different ways in which these images have transformed our understanding of New York City.\u00a0\u00a0***All screenings are on Fridays at 7pm***- September 13 - Voyeur NYC: Rear Window (dir.

    "description": "The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict has provoked many emotions (rage, guilt, victimization, condemnation), and a sense of hopelessness for its resolution. It is important to understand that the tragic events of the past year have occurred in the context of an intractable conflict. Intractable conflicts are characterized by master narratives that explain and justify the conflict for both sides. They support the necessity of the conflict as a zero-sum game. They also demonize the enemy and provide the set of arguments that is often associated with religious and moral superiority.This series is faculty-led and will explore the current Israel/Palestine conflict through the dynamics of intractability which includes psychological, historical and political components. We will hear the voices of both Israelis and Palestinian experts on the conflict, psychologists who study the relational effects of these master narratives, and hear from activists, local and international ones, who propose alternatives in this dismal landscape. These events are also organized to fulfill the mission of a University meant to prepare students through education, knowledge, and dialogue.  The seminars is collated by faculty members Warren Spielberg (NSPE) and Benoit Challand (NSSR).\u00a0Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

    "title": "2025 Management and Social Justice Conference Submission Call",
    "description": "We are pleased to invite scholars, educators, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and students to submit abstracts of papers, proposals for workshops and panel discussions to participate in the 2025 Management and Social Justice Conference to be held in New York.\u00a0Background:From May 2020, the Management and Social Justice collective has examined the peculiar and paradoxical challenge that haunts the field of management studies. On one hand, management is frequently demonized as a realm of oppressive ideas and practices on how to impoverish the world further by focusing on extractive economies that depend on endless growth. On the other, there is widespread agreement on the necessity for such ideas to make the world we inhabit a slightly better place and even use management theory and practice for collective advancement. Together, we have examined, debated, embraced, and critiqued these ideas and practices over the last four years in virtual conversations and in the 2023 conference held in New York City.\u00a0 Please visit our website for more information on the work done so far in virtual formats. For more information on the 2023 conference, visit, our conference website.\u00a0The Call:The continuing animating question is if it is possible think of management in terms of larger questions of social justice and use management ideas and practices to generate social justice (whether ecological, economic, racial, sexual, or gender). For the 2025 conference, we are focusing on the role of technology in shaping managing for social justice. Technology has a significant impact on how management thoughts evolve (Bodrozic & Adler, 2017; Bodrozic & Alder, 2022; Akhil, S.G. & Poonamallee, L. 2023). The role of technology innovation for solving social and environmental problems is well-established (Poonamallee, et.al. 2021; Scillitoe, et.al. 2019; Joy, et.al. 2022).\u00a0 However, it is a complicated space with contradictory beliefs and evidence. While technology has made workplace flexibility possible through remote work practices, it has given rise to surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2018). While technology innovation has led to an empowered civil society and citizen science applications, it has also led to organizations like Cambridge Analytica, psychological profiling of voters and targered misinformation and disinformation campaigns challenging the very foundations of democracy. Technology has bridged access and resource gaps in education and global health while also simultaneously deepening wealth gaps and data ownership and particularly the vulnerable and lower socioeconomic classes are subject to even more disempowerment. Open source, distributed, and collectively and cooperatively owned technologies are increasingly popular, wealthiest men on the planet who own close to half of the planet\u2019s wealth are all connected with technology as business. We hope to explore some of these issues in this conference in a critical, collaborative, and constructive fashion and continue to strengthen this community of inquiry and practice.We encourage submissions from a diverse array of fields and not just what one sees as traditional management, i.e. folks who work in business schools or work in businesses or occupy the role of managers or entrepreneurs. We welcome contributions from different disciplines including humanities and arts, different industries, different occupations, different vantage points, and different perspectives. Please see Annexure 1 at the end of this call for a list of potential (not exhaustive topics and questions).Full papers are not necessary for inclusion in this conference. Full papers if submitted however will be fast-tracked for review in an edited volume currently under consideration with Palgrave Macmillan/Springer, who published previous edited volumes Socio-Tech Innovation: Harnessing Technology Innovation for Social Good (2020) and Managing for Social Justice: Harnessing Management Theory and Practice for Collective Good (2023).Submission Information:All submissions must be at least 750 words and not more than 1500 words. We invite the following types of submissions:\u00a0- Scholarly submissions (750-1500 words): We will organize both traditional paper presentations and poster sessions.\u00a0- Proposals for Teaching Demos/Workshops Must have details about the workshop or demo design; must have an experiential component.\u00a0- Practice panels (minimum 1500 words). Practice panels should introduce the topic and list panelists who have agreed to participate and attend the conference and their expertise.\u00a0\u00a0We encourage all proposals to consider the implications for teaching and practice.\u00a0Please include a separate title page with names, affiliations, and email contact for all the submitters.Submit to poonamallee@newschool.edu\u00a0with the subject line Management and Social Justice Conference Submission.\u00a0Important Dates:Deadline for submission of abstracts: Nov 1, 2024Acceptance Notification: Dec 15, 2025Conference Early Bird registration: Feb 5, 2025Conference dates: March 6-8, 2025Email poonamallee@newschool.edu with questions.",

The panel is part of a series of public events coinciding\u00a0 with our current exhibition, Regeneration of Flax: Linseed, Linen, Shive & Oil at the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, 66 Fifth Avenue at 13th Street, New York.\u00a0With 60% of textile fibers made of synthetic polyester today, we look to the robust history of flax growing over the last 36,000 years, as a viable biobased alternative to synthetics.\u00a0 Flax is grown as a rotational crop and sequesters carbon as it grows. Flax fibers create linen fabrics, composites and insulation. Flax seed can be a food, or pressed into oils for finishes and flooring. Shive, a woody byproduct, is used for mulch and being researched for flaxlime.\u00a0 We will discuss the methods of farming organically and the potential of flax to remove heavy metals from soil. Experts will discuss the challenges of scaling, applications in the built environment\u00a0 and the benefits of local material sourcing for regional economies.\u00a0\u00a0What if designers were more connected with agriculture and the lifecycle of their materials?\u00a0The panel will be held from 5-6:30pm.\u00a0 The exhibition opening and reception 6:30-8pm.\u00a0RSVP Today!",

    "description": "Mark Setterfield, Leo Model Professor of Economics at NSSR&lt;\u00a0will present his latest paper, \"Integrating the Social Reproduction of Labor into Macroeconomic Theory.\"Abstract:The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the integration of unpaid care-giving in the household into short- and long-term macroeconomic theory and, in particular, the theoretical structure of production on the supply-side of the economy. The ambition of the project is to furnish a general theoretical representation of how unpaid care giving and its (gendered) social structure contributes to the technical conditions of production in the sphere of marketed output. In so doing, it aims to provide macro theorists with an apparatus that allows consistent description of both short-term (levels of activity) and long-term (rates of growth) macro outcomes in a manner that routinely integrates feminist insights regarding the gendered structure of the social reproduction of labor into macroeconomic analysis.Non-New School community members: Please register to get access to the buildings, as those that don't and are not on the RSVP list may be refused by security.",

Can the success of a radical protest movement offer a path through the climate crisis?\u00a0Filmmakers Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau will discuss their new film.

    "description": "Course will be conducted in Chinese. Chinese description follows English description below.This free 10-week online seminar offers a series of timely debates conducted in Chinese and aimed at a global Chinese audience, focusing on important and controversial issues in Chinese politics and international relations that cannot be freely discussed inside China. In each 90-minute session, guest debaters who are authorities in the subject area will be randomly assigned to present pro and con positions on the following propositions; the audience will vote on each proposition before the debate and at the end of the debate, and will also have a chance to pose questions.\u00a0We hope to help Chinese in China and around the world think through their own positions on a variety of issues facing China at home and abroad.Debate topics include:\u00a01. Democracy is suitable for China2. The China Model works well; it should be emulated by other countries3. The majority of Chinese people support the Chinese Communist Party4. China\u2019s long-term strategic goal is to overthrow the rule-based international order5. The West\u2019s engagement policy toward China was a failure6. The way modern technology is developing helps drive the trend toward authoritarianism7. It is not enough for the U.S. to manage competition with China, it needs to promote regime change8. Activists can effectively promote China\u2019s democratization through non-violent means9. Chinese people should support \u201cthe great unification\u201d\u00a0\u00a010.

    "description": "This symposium Chile's Design Stories: A Sociopolitical Journey to Modernity\u00a0(organized by Chile's Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage in collaboration with the School of Art & Design History & Theory) brings together diverse perspectives to offer a historical overview of Chile\u2019s cultural legacy and its connection to Latin American modernity. These reflections are centered on Chilean works featured in the exhibition Crafting Modernity: Design in Latin America, 1940\u20131980, currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art.Drawing from this collection of objects, authors, processes, and materials\u2014as well as their political and intellectual contexts\u2014the presentations will unveil a series of critical narratives about the relationship between design and modernity in Chile. These discussions will lay the groundwork for exploring methodologies to construct design histories through an analytical and contextualized lens.The symposium will feature presentations by design scholars Igor Fracalossi (Universidad Finis Terrae), Rita Hurtado (Universidad de Santiago), Fernando Portal (Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas), Tamara Poblete (University of Amsterdam), and Rodrigo Vera (Universidad de Chile).",

    "title": "Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico Book Launch",
    "description": "Book launch of Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico, including panel discussion and reception.The Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico documents and analyzes the diversity of collective memory projects throughout Mexico since the start of the \u201cwar against drug cartels\u201d, in a context of various intersecting and ongoing forms of violence. There are now\u00a0more than 110,000 victims of enforced disappearance and the numbers grow every month. Memorialization has been acknowledged as an important tool in the context of mass human rights violations and is often seen as a symbolic form of reparation for the victims, predominantly after regime change or a clearly-defined end to large scale violence. Compared to other cases in Latin America and other parts of the world, this has not been the case in Mexico. The scholars, activists, families of victims, architects and artists that write in this book address the pressing questions that emerge from the particularity of the Mexican case: Why would activists use the language and aesthetics of commemoration in the midst of ongoing violence and human rights abuses? What is the function of commemoration in the absence of peace and justice? What does it mean to commemorate in the absence of evidence and in the absence of bodies (i.e. in the case of the disappeared)?The Struggles for Memory examines historical connections across mobilizations around collective memory in Mexico in the context of the dirty war of the 1960s and 1970s and recent events from the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa in 2014, to the women who search for mass graves around the country, among a number of other memorialization efforts around the country, some well-known and others not so widely disseminated. The book challenges the framing of the violence merely as an issue related to drugs and organized crime. These interventions show the continuities in state violence over time, drawing attention to forms of structural violence that cut across enforced disappearances, violence against women, migrant deaths, resource extraction, attacks on activists and journalists, and the enduring discrimination against indigenous peoples and the dispossession of their lands.

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Klaus Vieweg, \"Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics of Painting\"",
    "description": "Abstract: What connects Hegel with Rembrandt? What are the important points of contact between the grand master of modern philosophizing and the virtuosos of Dutch painting? Why does Hegel, as an outstanding representative of the school of German Idealism, the golden age of modern philosophy, recognize in the paintings of Rembrandt and the Dutch school of the Golden Age a greatness of spirit and freedom, a revolution in painting, the modernity of this art of painting? Why is Hegel fascinated by such pictures of proud citizens, vegetable and herring sellers, street urchins, the poor and beggars, landscapes and Dutch mills, farmers at harvest and in the inn, women playing the piano, canals with skaters, bouquets of flowers and breakfast tables - depictions of seemingly banal scenes of everyday life?By laying the foundations for a modern aesthetic theory in his lectures on the philosophy of art, Hegel provides decisive arguments against classicist and romanticist devaluations of Dutch Golden Age painting. Against the glorification of antiquity (classicism) and the Christian Middle Ages (late romanticism), his philosophy of art brought about a paradigm shift towards the art of modernity as free art, an art of free spirituality - \"only in its freedom is beautiful art true art\". Hegel can be regarded as the founder of a modern aesthetic of painting in the sense of combining philosophy and art history.Bio: Klaus Vieweg is Professor of Classical German Philosophy at the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena and one of the world's leading Hegel experts. Vieweg has authored or edited over two dozen books, including Hegel. Der Philosophie der Freiheit (Munich: 2019) translated into English as Hegel: The Philosopher of Freedom (Stanford 2023).",

    "description": "*Please plan ahead and arrive 15 minutes prior to the event. Due to demand, tickets not processed by event start will be released. Thank you!The Westerlies: Wherein Lies The Good\u00a0The origins of The Westerlies go back to the high school bandrooms of Seattle, Washington, where the four original members first met and came of age together. In this program, the ensemble returns to their roots to celebrate music from their hometown, including Wherein Lies the Good, an expansive work by Robin Holcomb originally written for solo piano, as well as works by her contemporaries Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, and Ron Miles.\u00a0Repertoire to include:Wherein Lies the Good \u2014 Robin HolcombSweeter Than The Day \u2014 Wayne HorvitzCupid \u2014 Ron MilesMonroe \u2014 Bill Frisell\u00a0All arrangements by The Westerlies.The Westerlies are the Ensemble-in-Residence at the\u00a0School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School College of Performing Arts\u00a0\u00a0Free with registration / Space is Limited!\u00a0The Westerlies:The Westerlies, \u201can arty quartet\u2026mixing ideas from jazz, new classical, and Appalachian folk\u201d (New York Times) are a New York-based brass quartet comprised of Riley Mulherkar and Chloe Rowlands on trumpet, and Andy Clausen and Addison Maye-Saxon on trombone. From Carnegie Hall to Coachella, The Westerlies navigate a wide array of venues and projects with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family sing-along.Formed in 2011, the self-described \u201caccidental brass quartet\u201d takes its name from the prevailing winds that travel from the West to the East. \u201cSkilled interpreters who are also adept improvisers\u201d (NPR\u2019s Fresh Air), The Westerlies explore jazz, roots, and chamber music influences to create the rarest of hybrids: music that is both \"folk-like and composerly, lovely and intellectually rigorous\u201d (NPR Music).The ensemble has produced numerous critically acclaimed albums of genre-defying music. 2022 saw the release of the Songbook Vol. 2 and Live at TOURISTS on Westerlies Records, the ensemble\u2019s in-house record label. The previous year was a prolific year for the ensemble, with the release of Fireside Brass: A Westerlies Holiday (Westerlies Records), Songbook Vol. 1 (Westerlies Records), and Bricolage (Westerlies Records), a collaborative album of improvisations with pianist/composer Conrad Tao. 2021 also saw the release of This Land, the ensemble\u2019s collaboration with GRAMMY-nominated vocalist Theo Bleckmann. Sought-after collaborators, The Westerlies are also featured on recordings by Fleet Foxes (Nonesuch), Big Red Machine (Jagjaguwar), Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 (Six Degrees Records), Common (Lakeshore) and Dave Douglas (Greenleaf).Education and community engagement are core elements of The Westerlies' mission. In 2021, The Westerlies were named the inaugural small ensemble-in-residence at the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School. The Westerlies also produce an annual music festival in Seattle called Westerlies Fest, which combines evening performances featuring numerous guest artists, an all-day open-to-the-public creative music jamboree, and workshops in local public schools. The Westerlies have engaged students of all ages and abilities around the country with their innovative assemblies and masterclasses, promoting the values of cooperation and inclusion through music.This performance will be LIVESTREAMED.

If we are smart, we listen, we follow these murmurs and we see where they lead.\u00a0 Jon-Sesrie Goff does just that in After Sherman. His florid documentary eavesdrops on fragmented dialogues: between father and son, among friends and neighbors, between land and river and, of course, between the past and the present. These conversations are ambitiously framed by the director, in his notes, as meditations on inheritance and our nation\u2019s twisted history. And while After Sherman fulfills that mission, it\u2019s most captivating when it burrows into Goff\u2019s personal history, recording the stories and rituals of his Gullah Geechee community\u201d \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarke",

    "title": "Heuss Lecture | Christina Morina, \"A Thousand New Beginnings: Germans\u00a0and Their Democracy since the 1980s\"",
    "description": "\u00a0What motivates the federal republic? Nearly 75 years since its creation and more than thirty since reunification, German democracy is under pressure: political extremism is spreading, the major political parties are battling vanishing approval ratings, and resentment and anti-democratic feelings are on the rise. How did we get here?Renowned historian Christina Morina believes that to understand modern German history, we need to stop thinking of it as a straightforward story of democracy and dictatorship. In her new book,\u00a0Tausend Aufbr\u00fcche (A Thousand New Beginnings, English edition in preparation for 2025), she examines countless letters to politicians, petitions, leaflets and other documents to show how citizenship and democracy have meant different things to different people over the past 40 years. For the first time, this\u00a0political-cultural history of modern Germany looks at the 1989 revolution in light of the history of German democracy \u2013 revealing the diverse and stubborn ways in which Germans from all walks of life, east and west, have approached democracy in theory and in practice, how their ideas are shaping the so-called Berlin Republic, and the associated opportunities and dangers.Christina Morina is the 2024-2025 Visiting Heuss Professor in History at The New School for Social Research. She is Professor of General History with a particular focus on Contemporary History at the University of Bielefeld. Her research focuses on major themes in German and European history from the in 19th to the 21st century, particularly Nazism and the history of bystanding during the Holocaust; socialism, Marxism and communism; political and memory culture(s) in Germany since 1945, as well as the history of historiography.This annual Heuss Lecture is part of The New School for Social Research's General Seminar event series.

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

    "description": "In China, recent reforms have aimed at expanding social security coverage, improving healthcare, and addressing rural-urban disparities. India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance. ",

    "description": "Golem is the first full-length play written by Dylan Gottlieb after graduating from The New School's Dramatic Arts BFA in May 2021. This play is three acts with two intermissions.Golem offers a brief, ultimately insufficient glimpse of a world that has long since passed from the earth: that of Yiddish-speaking Eastern Europeans. This world was vibrant, culturally diverse, split between disparate political regimes, forming and shifting over centuries of migration, economic development, and change. By the end of the 19th century, democratic revolutions in Western Europe had long since ended anti-Semitic legal restrictions dating from the Medieval Era, allowing for the gradual integration of Jews into the broader society. But in Eastern Europe's autocratic and multinational empires, these restrictions persisted for longer. In 1900 the Russian Empire boasted the largest population of Jews of any state on earth, subjected to a distinctly anti-Semetic and repressive legal system within a territory known as the \"Pale of Settlement\" - the singular region of the Empire in which Jews were permitted to live, spanning parts of modern Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states.",

    "title": "Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Domingues | Liberalism & Republicanism: From Expansion to Retraction",
    "description": "Political modernity set off, through liberalism and a modern form of republicanism, programmatically and historically, with a rather oligarchical and abstract perspective. Accordingly, most citizens \u2013 if they were citizens at all \u2013 did not participate, at least fully, in the political system and had only civil rights \u2013 limited in particular for women but also for specific groups of the population, foremostly slaves. Abstractness hid however these concrete issues, besetting workers and the popular classes in general, as well as women, also in their plebeian political being. Abstractness implied also the personalization and personification of politics should be strictly limited. Through social and political struggles concreteness penetrated however the structure of the state, democratizing the political system of liberal republicanism, broadening political rights, and introducing social policies and rights, tending often to universalization. Highly oligarchical mass organizations \u2013 parties, unions, associations, churches \u2013 were crucial for this expansive moment. This movement has been reversed since the 1970s, implying a moment of retraction of republican liberalism towards a sort of de-democratized advanced oligarchical political system, despite the formal trappings of democracy, and the restriction of social policies, concentrated on the poor rather them aiming at the citizen. Concreteness has not disappeared, though, with society cut out in different groups and the personalization and personification of politics (so-called \u201cpopulism\u201d). This movement is internal rather than inimical to liberalism. At the same time, the \u201creal socialist\u201d (authoritarian collectivism) failed and returned to capitalism, although keeping the party-state form. It does not appear any longer as an alternative at all. The question that remains is whether republican liberalism can resume its expansive movement or whether, as authoritarian collectivism, it is exhausted in its creative capacities and historical dynamics and in terms of propelling social forces.",

    "title": "Pleistocene Park: Engineering Wilderness in a More-than-Human World",
    "description": "Pleistocene Park is a large-scale science experiment in Arctic Siberia in the form of a future-oriented rewilding project with the goal of mitigating climate change. The Park\u2019s creators hypothesize that introducing large herbivores into the area will slow the thawing of permafrost. Using the approach of multispecies ethnography, in attending to the nonhuman agencies at work in the project, Anya Bernstein (Harvard) argues that the Park differs from other rewilding projects, which are usually ecocentric, in emerging as a survivalist project with a distinct anthropocentric bent. Even so, however, the Park\u2019s survivalist goal for humans coexists with ontologies based on collaboration and mutual aid between humans and nonhumans, and between organic and inorganic matter, with extensive agency assigned to nonhuman others. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork within the frame of the Park\u2019s various genealogies, she traces the project\u2019s underlying assumptions in equal measure to the history of Russian science and to the experience of the Park\u2019s lead scientists of sociopolitical rupture following the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a case study, Pleistocene Park is especially suited to exploring issues of time and temporality, apocalypticism and redemption, extinction and eternity, in addition to particular visions of the natural and the human.",

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Mohamed Amer Meziane, \"Of Subterranean\u00a0Imperiality:\u00a0Heaven, Earth, and the Accumulation of Capital\"",
    "description": "How is the State involved in the climate crisis?\u00a0Drawing on\u00a0The States of the Earth\u00a0(Verso, 2024), Mohamed Amer Meziane (Brown University) will attempt to develop a theory of what he calls the Fossil State, partly based on a critical dialogue with Marxism\u00a0that differs from most eco-socialist perspectives. He will suggest that the concept of\u00a0imperiality (not coloniality) might help us analyze the theologico-political knot underpinning the modern capitalist State in both its religious and secular forms. Because the State never exists as an isolated entity but as part of a system of interconnected states, I will turn to inter-imperiality to describe aspects of the geopolitics of climate beyond the opposition between war and peace. By reinterpreting \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d in terms not only of State/colonial violence but of imperial secularization (not secularism), he thus wants to contribute to a different understanding of the entanglements of colonialism and capital and to try and find overlaps between eco-Marxist and anti-colonial approaches.Bio:\u00a0Mohamed Amer Meziane holds a PhD in Philosophy and Intellectual History from the University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. After teaching at Columbia University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life, he joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor of Francophone Humanities and Middle East Studies affiliated with the Watson Institute. He is the author of The States of the Earth: An Ecological and Racial History of Secularization. The book won the Albertine Prize for non-fiction in 2023 and was published in English in April 2024 by Verso Books. His second book was published in French in 2023. It is titled: Au bord des mondes. Vers une anthropologie m\u00e9taphysique (At the Edge of the Worlds: Towards a Metaphysical Anthropology).\u00a0His books have been reviewed in several media such as Le Monde, Mediapart and The Los Angeles Review Books. He is also invited to write texts about several contemporary artists for exhibitions catalogs, art galleries or journals such as Flash Art. ",

VLC Borderlands Curatorial Fellow Larissa Nez (Din\u00e9) introduces and moderates the conversation to ask: How can artists and historians correct or produce a \u201ccorrect\u201d record of Indigenous histories?

Does international law no longer matter in Hong Kong? &lt;a href=\"https://law.hawaii.edu/people/petersen/\"&gt;Carole Petersen&lt;/a&gt;, professor of law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, finds that in cases not affecting Beijing&amp;rsquo;s core interests, local judges still rely on international and comparative sources and still rule against the local Hong Kong government. This has been particularly evident in strategic litigation to advance the rights of the LGBT community. Petersen concludes that if the local government is serious about trying to rebuild Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s international reputation, then it should accept and fully implement these rulings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the significance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, I argue that it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. In this talk, I present our OLMo project aimed at building strong language models and making them fully accessible to researchers along with open-source code for data, training, and inference. I describe our efforts in building language modeling from scratch, expanding their scope to make them applicable and useful for real-world applications, and investigating a new generation of LMs that address fundamental challenges inherent in current models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;\nHanna Hajishirzi is the Torode Family Associate Professor in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a Senior Director of NLP at AI2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Her current research delves into various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular emphasis on accelerating the science of language modeling, broadening their scope, and enhancing their applicability and usefulness for human lives. She has published over 140 scientific articles in prestigious journals and conferences across ML, AI, NLP, and Computer Vision. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Intel Rising Star Award, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, Academic Achievement UIUC Alumni Award, and Innovator of the Year Award by GeekWire. The work from her lab has been nominated for or has received best paper awards at various conferences and has been featured in numerous magazines and newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;",

They are eager to learn local languages. Immigration is not a burden on social services. Border walls do not work. There is no unmanageable refugee crisis. Yet many such misinformed assumptions and harmful misconceptions pervade conversations about immigration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a timely, practical, and evidence-based discussion on immigrants and immigration. Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione debunk frequently encountered claims and answer common questions. Invoking the latest findings and decades of interdisciplinary research and considering a wide range of places, ethnic groups, and historical eras, Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione provide the key data and context to understand how immigration affects economies, crime rates, and social welfare systems, and shed light on contentious issues such as the safety of the U.S.-Mexico border and the consequences of Brexit. This conversation aims to be a guide for those who want to counter false claims about immigration and are interested in what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time will be allocated for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione have produced a powerfully-written and persuasive statement against several of the most common stereotypes about contemporary immigration.

As the South Asian subcontinent was partitioned in 1947 to gain freedom from Britain&amp;#39;s colonial hold, and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was formed, the city&amp;#39;s large Hindu and Sikh populations were pushed toward India, and an even larger Muslim refugee population settled in the city. This was just the latest in a long history of the city&amp;#39;s making and unmaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, the city has kept a firm grip on the imagination of travelers, poets, writers, and artists. More recently, it has been journalists who have been drawn to the city as a focal point for a nation that continues to grab international headlines. For this book, acclaimed historian Manan Ahmed Asif brings to life a diverse and vibrant world by walking the city again and again over the course of many years. Along the way he joins Sufi study circles and architects doing restoration in the medieval parts of Lahore and speaks with a broad range of storytellers and historians. To this Asif juxtaposes deep analysis of the city&amp;#39;s centuries-old literary culture, noting how it reverberates among the people of Lahore today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To understand modern Pakistan requires understanding its cultural capital, and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Disrupted City&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;uses Lahore&amp;#39;s cosmopolitan past and its fractured present to provide a critical lens to challenge the grand narratives of the Pakistani nation-state and its national project of writing history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://sofheyman.org/persons/manan-ahmed\"&gt;Manan Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor in the History Department at Columbia, is a historian of South Asia and the littoral western Indian Ocean world from 1000-1800 CE.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Unbound: Expanding American Book History &amp;amp; Textual Objects of Intercultural Encounters, The Columbia University Seminar in Material Texts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unbound&amp;quot; considers the impact on book history of the new collection, &lt;em&gt;American Contact: Objects of Intercultural Encounters and the Boundaries of Book History&lt;/em&gt; (UPenn Press, 2024). In forty-eight short chapters, &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the dynamics of intercultural encounters through the medium of material texts. Each essay focuses on one object to demonstrate how particular ways of reading can render the complex meanings of the objects legible\u2015or explains why and how the meanings remain illegible. In its diversity and breadth, this volume shows how the field of book history can be more inclusive and expansive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium features scholars from multiple disciplines and career stages. Together, across three panels, they will address questions about the role of collaboration in research, the pedagogical uses of &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt;, and the future of book history. Participants include Ahmed Alami, Rhae Lynn Barnes, Glenda Goodman, David Hall, Joseph Howley, Abimbola Cole Kai-Lewis, Isadora Mota, Shari Rabin, Martin Tsang, and Adrian Weimer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will be followed by a reception beginning at 4pm in the Rare Book &amp;amp; Manuscript Library on the 6th floor.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Humor is often at the center of complex legal cases and content moderation decisions regarding free speech and its limits. How can judges &amp;ndash; or social media platforms &amp;ndash; navigate the gray areas between satire and defamation, provocative jokes and hate speech, or parody and copyright violation? These challenges have become increasingly daunting in the digital age, with ironic ambiguity and context collapse playing a key role in online communication. Moreover, generative AI (e.g. deepfakes) has further muddled the line between legitimate creative reuse on the one hand (as in parody or satire), and the violation of personal or IP rights on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These issues lie at the center of the forthcoming toolkit&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Joke? Assessing Humor in Free Speech Jurisprudence and Content Moderation&lt;/em&gt;, authored by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alberto Godioli&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Groningen),&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sabine Jacques&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Liverpool),&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ariadna Matamoros Fern&amp;aacute;ndez&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Queensland University of Technology), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Young&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Groningen) with funding from the Dutch Research Council (&lt;a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/impexp23-24014\"&gt;NWO Impact Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;grant). The toolkit is primarily intended for legal professionals and Trust &amp;amp; Safety agents, with the aim of helping them establish an informed, well-balanced, and consistent approach to humorous expression in light of both human rights law and interdisciplinary humor research. However, it will also be of interest to policymakers and advocacy groups, by addressing topical questions concerning both the protection of lawful humorous expression and the adjudication of illegal or borderline (albeit superficially humorous) content. Lastly, it aims to assist humor creators of all types &amp;ndash; from comedians and cartoonists to &amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; social media users &amp;ndash; in gaining awareness of their rights, while also highlighting the links between certain types of derogatory humor, hate, and harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;October 25, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, the toolkit authors will join us at Columbia University to present an advanced draft of the toolkit and collect feedback before finalizing its publication, which is scheduled for January 2025.

Information technology has become essential for managing the US&amp;#39;s complex elections, and, when all goes well, provides great benefits in efficiency, accuracy, and usability. But computers and software are also notoriously (and fundamentally) unreliable and vulnerable to tampering, and the systems we use for voting and election management are no exception. In some ways, the integrity of election outcomes has become dependent on the integrity of technology that may not always work as intended. Can we trust election outcomes? Should we?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, recent advances have found reliable methods for conducting high-integrity elections even with flawed (or malicious( technology. This talk will examine the technologies used in elections, the ways they can fail, and practical safeguards that mitigate risks they introduce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;\nMatt Blaze, Ph.D., is a professor of law at Georgetown Law and a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. For more than 25 years, Blaze&amp;rsquo;s research and scholarship has focused on security and privacy in computing and communications systems, especially as we rely on insecure platforms such as the internet for increasingly critical applications. His work has focused particularly on the intersection of this technology with public policy issues. For example, in 2007, he led several of the teams that evaluated the security of computerized election systems from several vendors on behalf of the states of California and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;",

Picking up on this theme, this seminar explores the role&lt;br /&gt;\nof central banks in governing finance not only in the midst of financial crises, but also&lt;br /&gt;\ncontinuously as guardians of financial stability. Remarkably, the shadow banking system, which&lt;br /&gt;\nhad largely been viewed as causal for the 2008 crisis, expanded rather than contracting under the&lt;br /&gt;\nwatch of central banks. When faced with new episodes of financial instability, central banks have&lt;br /&gt;\nresponded with more large-scale asset purchases and similar measures to support the financial&lt;br /&gt;\nsystem. This raises the question whether central banks are governing finance, or whether,&lt;br /&gt;\ninstead, finance is forcing central banks to dance to their tune. This is not a new question, and&lt;br /&gt;\nneither is it limited to the US, or even the circle of the C5 (Fed, Bank of England, ECB, Swiss&lt;br /&gt;\nCB, Bank of Japan). By putting the recent episodes of the entanglement of central banks with&lt;br /&gt;\nfinance into historical perspective, we are hoping to shed new light on the forces that shape&lt;br /&gt;\nmoney, banking, and finance more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lev Menand&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia Law School&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stefano Ugolini&lt;br /&gt;\nUniversity of Toulouse&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/FVAmbDuqbGfFkZzM6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Link to Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

These processes are pivotal to global water, carbon, and elemental cycles, with far-reaching implications for mantle rheology, climate stability, the origin of life on early Earth, submarine resources, subduction zone dynamics, and geohazards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Controlled-source marine seismic surveys are powerful tools for investigating these processes due to the capacity to generate high-resolution, extensive images of the oceanic lithosphere. However, traditional methods&amp;mdash;such as ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) traveltime tomography and multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection imaging&amp;mdash;often leave resolution gaps at various depths, limiting the quantitative imaging of fluid-related structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on advancing and applying high-resolution full waveform inversion (FWI) techniques in marine seismic studies to bridge these gaps and achieve &amp;lsquo;full-wavelength imaging&amp;rsquo;. In this presentation, I will highlight case studies where FWI of MCS data unveils hydrothermal pathways within the ultramafic Rainbow massif at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These findings, combined with Vp/Vs structures derived from local earthquake tomography, underscore the role of lithological contrasts. Additionally, I will demonstrate how FWI of OBS data helps quantify melt in the lower crust of an ultraslow-spreading ridge segment and elucidates the ocean to-continent transition at a magma-poor rifted margin offshore Nova Scotia. Finally, I will briefly discuss ongoing research projects and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hanchao Jian is a Research Associate at Woods Hole Oceanography Institution (WHOI). He earned his PhD in Marine Geophysics in 2017 through a joint program between Peking University and Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP). Before joinging WHOI, he did postdoctoral research at both IPGP and Dalhousie University. His research focuses on high-resolution imaging of oceanic crustal structure at plate boundaries, with a particular interest in fluid-related processes such as hydrothermal circulation and melt dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom link:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting ID: 927 8027 5650&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passcode: 582874&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For a complete view of the planned seminars this semester, please visit the calendar on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lamont.columbia.edu/events/geodynamics-seminars\"&gt;Geodynamics Seminar webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this newest essay, &lt;em&gt;Universaliser: L&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute; par les voies d&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute;,&lt;/em&gt; he argues that universalism can be conceived as a dialogue among different cultures in a way that recognizes and values these differences as equal contributions to the whole. No region in the world can claim to define universalism and impose its definition on the rest of the world. Thinking about humanity as a whole is infinitely difficult, and it requires a philosophy of de-centering and the elimination of cultural hierarchies to forge together, as equals, a collective conception of the universal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a time when ethnonationalism, tribal identities, and the violent domination of some countries and peoples over others are rising all around us, Souleymane Bachir Diagne retains his faith in humanity and defends universalism as a collective project for all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Souleymane Bachir Diagne&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor Philosophy and French at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Mame-Fatou Niang&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French Studies, the Founder | Director of the Center for Black European Studies at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Dodman&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French and Director of the History and Literature Program at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;IN-PERSON REGISTRATION IS CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;.

This fall, the seminar series will spotlight the work of CPRC members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julien Teitler &lt;/strong&gt;Professor of Social Work and Sociology. He is a member of CPRC&amp;rsquo;s steering committee and co-directs the Computing and Methods Core. Teitler&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on social determinants of health and fertility. Recent studies include cross-national comparisons of fertility trends, health, and health disparities; the effect of neighborhood racial composition on birth outcomes; the measurement of neighborhood contexts; the health trajectories of immigrants in the U.S.; and the consequences of elective Caesarians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Rundle&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; research focuses on the determinants of sedentary lifestyles and obesity and the health related consequences of these conditions. Andrew Rundle Co-directs the Built Environment and Health Research Group (beh.columbia.edu), a trans-disciplinary team of researchers studying how neighborhood built and social environments influence health, particularly physical activity and obesity risk. His work on urban design and neighborhood-level effects on health has been used as part of the scientific rationale for the New York City Active Design Guidelines and for the Mayor&amp;#39;s Food Policy Task Force&amp;#39;s Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) initiative. His work has been nationally recognized and he and his team are inaugural members of the American Institute of Architects Design and Health Research Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;",

The text for this publication originated in 2014 in reaction to Russia&amp;rsquo;s initial invasion into Ukraine and was completed amid anxiety about the presidential election in the United States. The texts are written in the language of absurdity grounded in a feminist critique of the persistent presence of war. G&amp;eacute;rard&amp;rsquo;s drawings taken from the French dictionary&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Petit Larousse&lt;/em&gt;, published in Paris in 1942 during the Nazi Occupation, appear alongside T&amp;euml;mkina&amp;rsquo;s texts. The artist was a small child then and it was encouraging for him to look at the images of athletes playing traditional male sports. In imagery of fighting cavemen, fragmented dinosaurs, sportsmen, and combative games, G&amp;eacute;rard contends with the dissonance between play and violence, strength and growth, and word and image. These original drawings are presented at the Harriman Institute for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This exhibition focuses on the traumatic consequences of war for children&amp;rsquo;s psyches. What images and feelings does our conscience carry throughout life? Why do we, the children of the war and post-war period baby boomers, return to this experience of the family and collective traumas again and again? The exhibition includes T&amp;euml;mkina&amp;rsquo;s cycle of twelve texts &amp;ldquo;Children Who Starve&amp;rdquo; about the psychological self-negation as a result of food deprivation that children of the war experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is co-organized with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.russianamericanculture.com/\"&gt;Russian American Cultural Center.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

This two-part LC will consider these questions and the effect of interdisciplinary teaching more broadly. Among the goals of this LC is to consider the benefits of constructing a unified academy and what effect interdisciplinarity has on our students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Graduate student instructors at Columbia encounter students of every major and academic background, particularly in courses taught as part of the core curriculum and language instruction. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching is a valuable method by which to engage students across academic interests. It also supports students&amp;rsquo; learning across disciplines, highlights&amp;nbsp;how knowledge interconnects between academic departments, and encourages students to pursue their own interdisciplinary approach to learning. This LC is intended for participants from all academic disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and will be co-facilitated by Marissa Swan and Emma Leidy, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The ship hull ceiling&amp;mdash;a wooden structure resembling an inverted ship in construction and design&amp;mdash;was an adaptable building solution that flourished in the Upper Adriatic region of the Italian peninsula between c. 1300-1450. Ceilings were constructed using wood sourced from local forests, where timber was extracted, prepared, and transported through complex processes and infrastructures. This talk will examine how local timber extraction endowed artisans with the expertise to select wood suited to the needs of each ceiling and to navigate the numerous stages of preparing the raw materials. Additionally, Laura Hutchingame will highlight the innovative techniques that emerged from the dialogue between carpenters and nautical craftsmen and shed light on the diverse forms of labor that contributed to the production of ship hull ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Laura Hutchingame, PhD student in Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/laura-hutchingame-crafting-ship-hull-ceilings-registration-1014709672947\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Mindanao, the second-largest island in the Philippines, has a long history of incarceration. The Spanish Empire built its first penal colony in San Ram&amp;oacute;n, Zamboanga, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Instead of sending deportees, Spanish officials incarcerated Filipinos to &amp;ldquo;try out&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;ensayar&amp;rdquo; in the documents) new methods of colonization through agriculture and the displacement of non-normative bodies from North (Manila) to South (Zamboanga). The project looks at the racial, ethical, political, and social issues involved in the penal colonization process in the Philippines. It exposes the legacies of colonial incarceration in the uses of the San Ram&amp;oacute;n prison, which still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://span-port.yale.edu/people/aurelie-vialette\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aur&amp;eacute;lie Vialette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Yale University, Department of Spanish and Portuguese), specializes in 19th-century Iberian cultural studies, focusing on the Filipino and Catalan contexts and engaging with acarcerality, disability, transatlantic movements, slavery networks, archives, popular music, journalist discourses, mass and working-class organizations.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Join Kristen Slesar, LCSW, for this engaging workshop that dives deep into the complexities of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Common misconceptions still persist today, like the idea that leaving an abusive partner ends the abuse. Questions like &amp;quot;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t she just leave?&amp;quot; continue to oversimplify the real dangers victims face&amp;mdash;dangers so severe that at least three women are murdered daily by current or former partners. Definitions of IPV that focus on individual acts of violence as opposed to coercive control perpetuate misconceptions and ineffective interventions that frequently fail to keep victims safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This workshop presents a comprehensive framework to understanding IPV within the context of social, relational, and structural entrapment. This framework will demonstrate how victims are ensnared not only by the coercive controlling violence of their partners but also by the societal, cultural, and political systems that generate vulnerability and fail to keep victims safe. Utilizing research and poignant case studies, Kristen will challenge participants to explore how centering coercive control as the underlying mechanism of IPV and treating IPV as a social&amp;mdash;and social justice&amp;mdash;problem is required to create more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;For development professionals focused on financing small business growth, understanding value drivers and how financial institutions invest in SMEs can offer valuable lessons for application in the developing world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;This session, led by Mr. de Mojana, will explore how value creation can boost innovation and growth, particularly in finance-constrained regions. He will discuss the characteristics of a robust financial system that can support dynamic and competitive SMEs and provide insights on applying these models to developing economies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBackground:&lt;br /&gt;\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in driving economic growth and fostering bottom-up development worldwide. These businesses, led by local entrepreneurs and workers, are often more formal and employ more people than micro- enterprises, yet they still face challenges such as weak governance, limited management capacity, and restricted access to markets and financial services. In Europe, SMEs make up over 99% of all businesses, with nearly 23 million enterprises employing around 100 million people, accounting for two-thirds of total employment. SMEs are integral to economic resilience and innovation, making access to finance&amp;mdash;through well-functioning banking systems, venture capital, and supportive public policies&amp;mdash;essential for their sustained growth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn Africa, SMEs contribute up to 60% of employment and 40% of GDP in some countries, while in Latin America, they represent over 90% of businesses and are responsible for around 70% of employment. Asia&amp;#39;s economic landscape is similarly dominated by SMEs, which make up more than 95% of all enterprises and employ a significant portion of the workforce, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asia. These businesses are vital for economic development, innovation, and poverty reduction.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco de Mojana, Founder and CEO of Buono Ventures Holding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. de Mojana is a private equity and financial sector professional with a growth focused approach to value creation. He is Founder and CEO of Buono Ventures Holding, an Italian-based investment firm focused on supporting emerging businesses and brands with equity and sector expertise. Previously, he was a partner at Permira, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest European private equity firms from January 2004 until December 2018, where he was involved in a over 1.5 billion Euro of investments in the consumer and digital consumer space. From 2002 until 2004 he was the Co-founder and COO of a software knowledge management solution company later sold to Telefonica Group, and from 1997 until 2000 he was at McKinsey &amp;amp; Company in London and Milan. He is currently a member of the board of directors of several private companies in the consumer space. Mr. de Mojana holds a B.A in International Economics from Universit&amp;agrave; Bocconi in Milan, and an MBA from Columbia University Business School in New York.&lt;/p&gt;",

This lexicographical resource has no analogues in either Slavic or English lexicography. It gained accolades from linguists and users alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yuri Shevchuk&amp;#39;s Ukrainian-English Collocation Dictionary is a highly welcome addition to Ukrainian lexicology, the first of its kind to present the most frequently found combinations of Ukrainian words in a modern setting with fluid, pitch-perfect English translations. It will be a major reference for students learning Ukrainian, for travelers, and for advanced speakers of Ukrainian, who will profit from its wide-ranging morphological, syntactic and lexical detail.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Michael S. Flier, the Oleksander Potebnia Professor of Ukrainian Philology, Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shevchuk has not only produced an infinitely helpful resource for anyone interested in Ukrainian, but given us one of the most breathtaking scholarly achievements in Slavonic Studies in many years. It is a monument to the Ukrainian language and a watershed in its development on the global stage.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Rory Finnin, Professor of Ukrainian Studies, University of Cambridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The publication of this Ukrainian-English Collocation Dictionary comprises a monumental event in Ukrainian lexicology. . . . The sheer abundance and quality of information in Shevchuk&amp;#39;s entries should make his dictionary a primary source that translators and learners should go to in seeking translations of Ukrainian words and expressions. Shevchuk&amp;#39;s collocation dictionary, the first of its kind for any Slavic language, should also serve as a useful template for future compilers of similarly constructed dictionaries for the Slavic world. . . . a remarkable contribution to Ukrainian lexicology that will have meaningful impact for decades to come.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash; Slavic Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Widespread access to generative AI is changing design practices as we speak. In this summit we will ask how this is happening and how to evaluate it &amp;ndash; politically, socially, technically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although the question of artificial intelligence has a long history, things have changed so dramatically in recent years that some thinkers have suggested that we have entered an era of post-human design. We will focus on the short history of generative AI, machine learning, and predictive algorithms and the explosion of tools and methods which open access to them has produced. Thanks to diffusion and large language models, which have become regular collaborators in many design processes, designers have the ability to talk to computers in ordinary language and ask them to do complicated things, like code, draw on archives, analyze and optimize data, even build new models and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will consider the implications of this explosion across all scales of practice at GSAPP, and the difference it is already making, in a day-long gathering November 1, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a series of panels, participants will present their work and discuss how their methods and practices have altered with new AI tools. We will ask about the difference between human and algorithmic intelligence. We will see how AI can be designed locally with local knowledge. We will address the systems architecture and politics behind AI in a more-than- human world. We will speculate on future modes of design practice that generative AI allows, or does not allow. We will query our queries &amp;ndash; text to image, text to code, text to video, text to the unknown in the future. We will assess quantitative versus qualitative measures guiding AI policies in urban contexts, as well as what might motivate parameters in urban design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, we hope to have introduced and interrogated the affordances of these new tools in relation to what we do as designers. The conference will include participatory methods intended to gather the perspectives of the audience and the speakers. It is our hope that the findings can be used as the basis for future discussion about AI and its impact on design environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAIG_t_fQzxmBBVeyoVPssmrzfayOt9NmEWaqFNFqaqzph4w/viewform?usp=sf_link\"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to register for the conference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Whether you are currently teaching at Columbia or not, all graduate students looking to practice teaching are welcome to attend this Practice Teaching session.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some teaching skills you could practice at this session include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introducing new content, concepts, or skills to students (i.e., an engaging mini-lecture)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Testing new and varied modes of student engagement to boost participation and inclusivity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using of visuals (blackboard, whiteboard, slide decks, handouts, etc.) to bolster learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitating discussion (i.e., posing discussion questions, monitoring student engagement, attention, and learning, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participants should determine which skill they wish to focus on and come prepared with something to teach their peers in an active and engaging way. Registrants will be provided additional guidance to help prepare for Practice Teaching in the week prior to the session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Practice Teaching sessions are facilitated by CTL&amp;#39;s trained graduate student Teaching Consultants. These sessions satisfy the &amp;ldquo;Application and Practice&amp;rdquo; requirement in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://tdp.ctl.columbia.edu/\"&gt;Teaching Development Program&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

For example, for deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, aligning the nuclear spins parallel to the magnetic field increases the cross section by a factor of 1.5. Because fusion reaction products will heat the fuel ions in a fusion reactor, a 50% increase in cross section nearly doubles the fusion power, relaxing the requirements to achieve a practical fusion reactor. Furthermore, the higher probability of a reaction substantially reduces the required tritium inventory. A key question is: will spin polarized fuel remain polarized in a fusion reactor environment? Theoretically, the two most important depolarization mechanisms are hyperfine interactions with bound electrons and resonances with electromagnetic waves at nuclear precession frequencies&amp;mdash;the process that occurs in magnetic resonance imaging. For reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll explain, despite the rich spectrum of electromagnetic waves in the fusion environment, it is theoretically predicted that the polarization lifetime will exceed the amount of time the fuel spends in the plasma. Plans to measure the polarization lifetime on the DIII-D tokamak using cryogenic LiD and 3He shell pellets will be discussed, as well as prospects for experiments at other facilities.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;: William &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; Heidbrink is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy in the School of Physical Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Heidbrink earned his B.A. degree from the University of California, San Diego in 1977. For the next two years he performed industrial research in pulsed power at Maxwell Laboratories. In 1984, he received his Ph.D. from Princeton University. After working as a staff member on the TFTR tokamak (Princeton) and the DIII-D tokamak (General Atomics), he joined the UCI Physics Department in 1988. He also has won the UCI &amp;quot;Lauds and Laurels&amp;quot; Distinguished Teaching Award and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 2004, he received the Excellence in Plasma Physics Research award from the Americal Physical Society. Professor Heidbrink&amp;#39;s research involves studies of &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; ions in magnetized plasma.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis talk will be offered in a hybrid format.

In our observational studies, we have investigated how different biomarkers relate to each other over time, and how they associate to diseases and drug treatments. Using large data sets including genotypes and Swedish national registers, we apply causal inference methods to provide stronger causal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Describing a governmental approach that simultaneously incentivizes a can-do spirit and suppresses dissent, the book points out resonances between authoritarian and neoliberal ideologies in today&amp;#39;s comeback of strongman rule. Drawing on field observations, in-depth interviews, and analyses of video clips, it conveys the look and feel of flexible authoritarianism in Russia through the eyes of up-and-coming youth. The author analyzes ways in which the insignia of cool start-up capitalism and familiar cultural forms such as the summer camp help stabilize the regime, while also showing how up-and-coming youth both embrace and contest loyalty to the government.&lt;/p&gt;",

This seminar will present results from two studies on disparities in healthy life expectancy among older Americans. In the first, we analyzed the health and economic well-being of five cohorts of Americans in their mid-fifties between 1994 and 2018, focusing on the middle of the economic distribution. Using a dynamic microsimulation based on the Health and Retirement Study, we simulated their future life-course, including estimating health-quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). We found QALE for the upper-middle income group had increased between cohorts, but it stagnated for their lower-middle peers. Economic outcomes followed similar patterns. The results suggest the relatively neglected &amp;ldquo;forgotten middle&amp;rdquo; group of near-retirees may require stronger supports than are currently available to them. In the second study, we similarly used a microsimulation to estimate QALE at age 60 for rural and urban Americans. We found substantial disparities in QALE for rural men relative to their urban counterparts, with much smaller differences for women, and these gaps had grown larger over time. Counterfactual scenarios suggested eliminating smoking and managing obesity and prevalent heart conditions would be particularly beneficial for increasing rural QALE and reducing this urban-rural gap. However, the results suggested interventions earlier in life might be needed to fully address the urban-rural disparity in QALE at older ages. The seminar will conclude with a brief overview of some future research efforts to identify solutions to these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

EVI1 is part of the MECOM (MDS1-EVI1 Combination) locus, from which the long form MDS1-EVI1 and the short form EVI1 are transcribed from two different promoters. Although EVI1 is expressed at high levels, MDS1-EVI1 is absent or expressed at very low levels in inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs. Overexpression of EVI1 in inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs is caused by the relocation of a long distant enhancer of GATA2, originally situated at chromosome 3q21. Enhancer hijacking by EVI1 has not only been found in the classical inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs, but also in other 3q26 rearranged variants, e.g. t(2;3), t(3;7), t(3;8) or multiple other t(3;v) leukemias. Most enhancers hijacked in those leukemias represent socalled super-enhancers and are donated by genes that are normally expressed in primitive HSPCs. Our research focusses on the common mechanism of those enhancers to drive EVI1 overexpression. We address which combination of transcription factors (TF) drive transcription via the hijacked enhancers and how we may interfere with the activity of the TF/enhancer complex. We hypothesize that this knowledge will provide ways to target this otherwise incurable form of AML. In a second project, we obtain knowledge about the function of EVI1. EVI1 encodes a DNA binding repressor of transcription. Interference with its function as a repressor may provide another way to inhibit outgrowth of this leukemia. In this lecture, the mechanism of aberrant expression as well as the role EVI1 in MECOM rearrangement AMLs will be discussed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/SZDZ6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1130 St. Nicholas Ave., New York, NY 10032&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/SZDZ6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Room/Area: 1st floor auditorium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Aaron Viny, MD, Assistant Professor of Genetics &amp;amp; Development, CUMC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is sponsored by the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;#39;s (HICCC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/research/researchers/edward-p-evans-center-myelodysplastic-syndromes-mds\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Edward P.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Small Rain: A Reading and Conversation with Garth Greenwell,&amp;quot; moderated by Nellie Hermann&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For our November rounds we are thrilled to welcome Garth Greenwell, award-winning author of What Belongs to You and Cleanness, who will be speaking about his most recent novel, &lt;a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/small-rain-garth-greenwell/21127652?ean=9780374279547\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt;, a poet&amp;#39;s life is turned inside out by a sudden, wrenching pain. The pain brings him to his knees, and eventually to the ICU. Confined to bed, plunged into the dysfunctional American healthcare system, he struggles to understand what is happening to his body, as someone who has lived for many years in his mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt; is a searching, sweeping novel set at the furthest edges of human experience, where the forces that give life value--art, memory, poetry, music, care--are thrown into sharp relief. Time expands and contracts. Sudden intimacies bloom. &lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt; surges beyond the hospital to encompass a radiant vision of human life: our shared vulnerability, the limits and possibilities of sympathy, the ideal of art and the fragile dream of America. Above all, it is a love story of the most unexpected kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Garth Greenwell is the author of &lt;em&gt;What Belongs to You&lt;/em&gt;, which won the British Book Award for Debut of the Year, was longlisted for the National Book Award, and was a finalist for many other awards, including the PEN/Faulkner and the LA Times Book Prize. His second work of fiction, &lt;em&gt;Cleanness&lt;/em&gt;, was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award and a New York Times Notable Book.&amp;nbsp;His nonfiction appears widely, and he writes regularly about culture for the Substack newsletter &lt;a href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgarthgreenwell.substack.com%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cknm2136%40cumc.columbia.edu%7C1c5eb376e07741f400c608dcacc97f45%7Cb0002a9b0017404d97dc3d3bab09be81%7C0%7C0%7C638575229888173806%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=QGWd1%2BJUNwWR5w5ulMZwUxNSg3vApEDDQ%2Fx%2BTt1iHxY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;To a Green Thought&lt;/a&gt;. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Harold D.

These deep inequities determine the disparate health experiences of rich and poor, Black and white, men and women, immigrant and native-born, boss and worker, Indigenous and settler. This book underscores that powerful people and institutions have always seen some lives as more valuable than others, and it emphasizes how those who have been most affected by the disparities in rates of disease and death have challenged and changed these systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

He will focus on the small but critical &amp;ldquo;window of opportunity&amp;rdquo; in the negotiation process when de-escalation is possible: &amp;ldquo;This brief period of reflection and weighing options creates the potential for cooperation, but it is essential to act quickly. Failure to recognize or seize this opportunity can result in full-scale escalation. The importance of timely action in preventing a full-blown conflict will be a key theme of the discussion.&amp;rdquo; Following a presentation and conversation, there will be time for audience questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zoom link will be distributed to all registrants 24 hours in advance of the webinar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Kjerstin Pugh (kep2137@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

Dodman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the first hundred years following legal emancipation across the French empire in 1848, in what ways did autobiographical narratives, prose fiction, and poetry address the continuation of black unfreedom? In this talk, A. V&amp;eacute;ronique Charles examines literary constructs of unfreedom within early twentieth-century Black literary production alongside bound fugitive slave narratives that circulated between Senegal and the metropole in the 1880s. This literary periodization specifically predates the institutional study of the respective fields of Caribbean and African literature. Charles notably charts a literary problem space through which readers can parse slavery&amp;rsquo;s past in canonical and lesser-known writings by Senegalese, Reunionese, and Antillean intellectuals, or &amp;eacute;volu&amp;eacute;s, whose citizenship dates back to nineteenth-century abolition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

It is comprised mainly of an Fe&amp;ndash;Ni alloy, plus&amp;nbsp;&amp;sim;10% lighter elements whose identities and abundances remain unknown. Here we describe several distinct approaches to constraining the core&amp;rsquo;s composition. A geo-/cosmochemical approach involves comparing the compositions of the bulk silicate Earth and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s building blocks to determine the core&amp;rsquo;s composition, especially for moderately volatile elements. High pressure&amp;ndash;temperature mineral physics data can be used to identify which light elements, at specific abundance levels, are able to match the core&amp;rsquo;s seismic properties (e.g., density, sound velocities, liquidus phase relations). The range of light element contents can also be constrained by incorporating metal&amp;ndash;silicate partitioning results into models of Earth&amp;rsquo;s core formation, which offers insight into not only the Earth&amp;rsquo;s core composition but also the conditions and mechanisms of core formation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom link:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For a complete view of the planned seminars this semester, please visit the calendar on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lamont.columbia.edu/events/geodynamics-seminars\"&gt;Geodynamics Seminar webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp is a two-day intensive boot camp combining lectures, hands-on activities, and discussions to demystify the NIH application process. This training will prepare participants to submit an NIH grant proposal that turns reviewers into advocates, positioning the applicant for success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2-day NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp: Building a Strong Foundation for Funding Success will provide comprehensive training that supplies researchers with the tools to write persuasive, effective grant proposals. Through a combination of seminars, discussions, examples, and hands-on activities, with a particular focus on navigating between-the-lines on how to tailor your proposals to grant reviewers, this training will orient you to all aspects of the academic funding process (i.e., grant writing and grant strategizing), including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to identify and apply for the right funding opportunities with the NIH (and beyond);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to position your research and yourself to make reviewers your research advocates;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to target your application to the right place at the right time; and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to write clearly, effectively, and persuasively when telling your scientific story.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Audience and Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators from any institution and from all career stages are welcome to attend, and we particularly encourage trainees and early-stage investigators to participate. No prior experience in preparing or submitting NIH grant applications is necessary. However, each participant should be prepared to share* and work on an NIH Specific Aims page and an NIH biosketch. Participants who have not previously written an NIH-style Aims page and/or biosketch will have an opportunity to draft their page and receive initial feedback ahead of the on-site workshop. There are no other requirements to attend the NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*Hands-on activities will use participant aims pages, and we therefore request that all participants respect the confidentiality of other attendees. Any participant who prefers not to share their research ideas may create a mock aims page to use during the boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbia.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=60d3eb536eacd93ffd4c56c08&amp;amp;id=8909a5c93b\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Subscribe for updates on new Boot Camp details and registration deadlines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:Columbia.GrantWriting@gmail.com\"&gt;Contact the NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp team.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Capacity\u202fis\u202flimited.

Using the case of labor mobilization in Belarus, the study examines cross-sector variation in civil resistance. It is hypothesized that the degree of the spatial concentration of employees and a prior record of labor activism in certain industries shapes the choice of the methods of resistance to the regime. Data for this study come from in-depth interviews with Belarusian labor activists and social media. A close analysis of labor mobilization in Belarus contributes to the political science literature by demonstrating diverse ways in which industrial workers might engage in resistance to the authoritarian regime.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This presentation offers insights from the 4-OCEANS project, a comprehensive initiative exploring human-marine interactions throughout history, and presents specific findings on climate-economy dynamics in early modern Europe. The 4-OCEANS project addresses three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When and where was marine exploitation significantly impactful on human society?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How did socio-economic, cultural, and environmental forces influence marine exploitation?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What were the consequences of marine exploitation for societal development and ocean ecosystems?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within this broader context, we focus on a case study examining climate-economy interactions in early modern Europe (1565-1785). Using advanced econometric techniques, we analyze how climate variability and socio-political factors affected food prices across 14 European cities. Our findings reveal that extreme weather events, particularly when coinciding with periods of conflict like the Thirty Years&amp;#39; War, significantly impacted price dynamics and market integration. This research contributes directly to the 4-OCEANS project by illuminating the complex interplay between environmental factors, human activities, and economic systems over time. By examining these historical patterns, we gain insights into the long-term consequences of human-environment interactions, addressing the project&amp;#39;s core questions about the impacts and drivers of marine exploitation. These findings not only deepen our historical knowledge but also inform current debates on climate change, resource management, and economic resilience, demonstrating the relevance of the 4-OCEANS project to contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ccsr.columbia.edu/people/michael-puma\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Michael Puma&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Research Scientist at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://emiledesmaili.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Emile Esmaili&lt;/a&gt;, Research Assistant at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to Columbia University ID holders; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-oceans-to-markets-marine-exploitation-and-climate-economy-dynamics-tickets-1049569309057\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the History and Climate Change workshop series hosted by the &lt;a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/content/research-cluster-environmental-sciences-and-humanities\"&gt;Environmental Sciences and Humanities Research Cluster&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Science and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Center for Science and Society makes every reasonable effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

    "description": "Stitches To Hold the World TogetherIn the workshop series, we will be focusing on understanding the ways in which women's traditions of stitching have helped them to \"hold their worlds together\" in the face of displacement, poverty, enslavement, war, isolation, and other challenges. We will celebrate the resiliency of their traditions as we learn about them and get to make them ourselves.\nIn our first workshop, we made traditional French Biscornu (meaning \u201cbizarre\u201d) pincushions, a tradition that emerged after the Nazi occupation in the Second World War as a way to use small scraps to replace traditional stitchery tools that had been lost in the war.\nIn this second workshop, we will be making hand-pieced friendship star blocks. In the 19th Century, women in the young United States began to make patchwork as a way to use and re-use expensive industrially milled fabrics, often in imitation of English chintz patterns that were outlawed for purchase in the U.S. One of the patterns that emerged in this time was the \"friendship star,\" a patchwork pattern that connected small patches into a star shape. These came to be known as friendship stars because it became a common practice among young women to make and give star blocks to their friends as tokens; these would be sewn together by the recipients with blocks from other friends to make an \"album\" quilt that would help them to remember friends who they might not see after they married, and as more people began to move around the U.S. to follow work or head westward. These friendship star album quilts attest to the close relationships among women built as they stitched together that survived the rapid changes as the U.S. became more urban, industrial, and mobile.\nThis is an easy project for every level of sewer, especially beginners. They make excellent gifts for friends.\nThe workshop starts at noon and the learning part is completed by 12:30pm\u2014after that is just hanging out and stitching together. Come for a little or all.\nSupplies will be provided. Coffee, tea, and snacks, and good company. All are welcome\u2014students, staff, and faculty.

As soon as the existence of an attractor is determined, one would like to know if it persists in a family of systems and in which way i.e. its stability. Attractors of one-dimensional systems are well understood, and their stability as well. I will discuss attractors of two-dimensional systems, starting with the special case of Henon maps. In this setting very little is understood. Already to determine the existence of an attractor is a very difficult problem. I will survey the known results and discuss the new developments in the understanding of attractors, coexistence of attractors and their stability for two-dimensional dynamical systems.\n\nDate:\nOctober 22, 2024\nTime:\n12:30 PM \u2014 1:30 PM\nCollege:\nThe City College of New York\nAddress:\nCity College of NY, 160 Convent Avenue, New York, NY 10031\nManhattan\nBuilding:\nNorth Academic Center, Room 6/113\nPhone:\n(212)650-5346\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/seminar/mathematics-colloquium/talk/245/",

    "description": "We invite you to an engaging conversation between\u00a0Voices of Light\u00a0composer\u00a0Richard Einhorn\u00a0and Music Director and Conductor David Hayes, at the Mannes School of Music at The New School. They\u2019ll discuss the inspiration behind this moving piece, how it was created, the difficulties of composing and conducting for film, and the lasting impact of the film\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc.Free to the public, but space is limited. Please RSVP.Wollman Hall, The New SchoolEugene Lang Building, Room B50065 West 11th StreetAbout the upcoming performance of Voices of LightOn\u00a0November 1, 2024, the New York Choral Society will present\u00a0Voices of Light, a work by New York native Richard Einhorn, for orchestra, soloists, and chorus. This compelling piece will be paired with the legendary\u00a0silent film\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, which chronicles the trial and torment of Joan of Arc in the hours leading up to her execution.Starring the famous Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise actress Ren\u00e9e Falconetti, this recently restored 1928 film, originally censored by the Catholic Church, offers a unique opportunity for both film and music lovers to experience the movie on a large screen at\u00a0Alice Tully Hall, in partnership with the\u00a0Mannes Orchestra.\u00a0This production has been made possible through the generous support of the Martin L. Finkelman Bequest.Featured Soloists:\u00a0THE POLYPHONISTSAmy Broadbent, SopranoSylvia Leith, Mezzo-SopranoMatthew Hill, TenorEdmund Milly, Bass-BaritoneVoices of Light November 1 at Alice Tully Hall-TicketsAbout Voices of LightVoices of Light\u00a0is an oratorio by New York native Richard Einhorn, inspired by\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, the iconic 1928 silent film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The piece uses a libretto based on excerpts from ancient writings, predominantly those of medieval female mystics, including texts directly from Joan of Arc\u2019s accusers and her own responses.This composition employs a multi-layered musical structure designed to evoke the polyphonic music of Joan\u2019s era, featuring a dramatically slowed-down Gregorian chant overlaid with multiple Texts.About The Passion of Joan of ArcThe film,\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, is considered a masterpiece of cinema, known for its stark portrayal of the emotional depth of its protagonist, portrayed by Ren\u00e9e Falconetti in a legendary performance that remains a touchstone of film acting. The film\u2019s visual style, coupled with Einhorn\u2019s moving composition, creates an immersive experience that has captivated audiences worldwide. Influencing directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg, (and boasting a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), this film has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Previously lost to fire and believed destroyed, a perfect copy of the film was discovered and has been meticulously restored, allowing modern audiences to experience Dreyer\u2019s visionary work as it was originally intended.",

    "title": "Film screening Emergent Cities and dialogue with participants from The Sunset Park is not for Sale Oral History Project",
    "description": "Join us for a screening of the newly released documentary Emergent City, which captures one of the most intense community battles against real estate development in recent history. The screening will be followed by a conversation with filmmaker Kelly Anderson and community members featured in the film, who are also part of the Sunset Park is Not for Sale Oral History Project.\u00a0About the Documentary FilmOver a decade, within the borders of a single Brooklyn community district, a microcosm of American democracy emerges. Residents of Sunset Park face a tangled web of rising rents, a legacy of environmental racism and the loss of the industrial jobs that once sustained their community. When a global developer purchases Industry City - a massive industrial complex on the waterfront - and begins to transform it into an \u201cinnovation district,\u201d a battle erupts over the future of the neighborhood and of New York City itself.Emergent City\u00a0is an observational civic epic. It sheds light on power and process, illuminating systems and giving viewers a front row seat to the public and private spaces where the city is shaped. With extraordinary access, it tracks an ensemble of participants including the local council member, Industry City\u2019s developers and community members with divergent stakes. The film explores the profound intersections of gentrification, climate crisis and real estate development, and asks how change might emerge from dialogue and collective action in a world where too many outcomes are constrained by money, politics and business as usual.For more information about the documentary film, click here.\u00a0Panelists\u00a0Kelly Anderson, Director and Producer of Emergent CityKelly Anderson is a Sunset Park based documentary filmmaker whose most recent film is\u00a0Rabble Rousers: Frances Goldin and the Fight for Cooper Square\u00a0(w. Ryan Joseph and Kathryn Barnier). Her 2012 film\u00a0My Brooklyn, about the hidden forces driving gentrification, was broadcast on PBS\u2019\u00a0America ReFramed. Kelly produced and directed\u00a0Every Mother\u2019s Son\u00a0(PBS, 2004, w. Tami Gold), about mothers whose children were killed by police, which won the Tribeca Audience Award and aired on POV. She produced and directed\u00a0Out At Work\u00a0(HBO, 2000, w. Tami Gold), which premiered at Sundance. Kelly chairs the Department of Film and Media Studies at Hunter College (CUNY).\u00a0Jay Arthur Sterrenberg, Director and Producer of Emergent CityJay Arthur Sterrenberg is a New York City based director and editor.

Jay is a co-founder of the Sunset Park based Meerkat Media Collective. His short documentary Public Money (PBS, 2018) is an observed portrait of an experiment in participatory democracy in Sunset Park.\u00a0Marcela Mitaynes, Assembly member representing 51st District in Brooklyn (To be confirmed)Marcela Mitaynes is a Peruvian-American politician and tenant organizer, currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly. She represents the 51st District as a Democrat, which includes Red Hook, Sunset Park, and northern Bay Ridge in Brooklyn.Through her work with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, and with tenants throughout New York State, Marcela was instrumental in the passage of the historic Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. This legislation dramatically and comprehensively strengthened the rights of tenants in rent-stabilized apartments to defend their homes and communities.\u00a0Marcela is continuing to organize in the district and help build power for working class people. All New Yorkers deserve access to housing, health care and energy. We need to build a mass, working-class movement to win a future where working-class people have a chance to live dignified lives.",

    "title": "Special Pre-release Film Screening Opens and Closes: The Future of Edinburgh\u2019s Histories",
    "description": "\u00a0\"Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful and everything conceals something else.\"\u2014Italo CalvinoThis is a film about how cities imagine their futures and the methods they use to manage them. Today, the future looms over cities in a hyperconnected tangle of crises. Sharpening inequalities, carbon climate feedback, technological acceleration, and opaque financial infrastructures combine in a clamor for new ideas, new plans, and new methods. But city futures are never just about cities and they are never just about futures; they are about policies and deals, actors and sectors, ideas and theories, instruments and methods. They are about places, sunk in space, meshed across regions and nations and curved across the globe. They are inherently and dynamically relational and radically contingent. Between the acknowledged past and the imagined future, the lines connecting land and water, science and industry, government and universities, people and money, are the formula, the twisted helix meant to fix the trouble we\u2019re in.A film by:Sapphire GossProduced, written, and narrated by:Prof Liz McFall,\u00a0University of EdinburghDiscussion by:- John Bruce\u00a0-\u00a0School of Design Strategies, Parsons- Evren Uzer, PhD\u00a0-\u00a0School of Design Strategies, ParsonsSapphire Goss is a British artist who works with experimental moving image and photographic processes to create an \u2018analogue uncanny\u2019.

Renfield is drugged by the eerily hypnotic count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to London. After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then calls in a specialist, Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's health. Van Helsing, realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's fiance, John Harker, and Dr. Seward for what is to come and the measures that will have to be taken to prevent Mina from becoming one of the undead.\u2014Doug Sederberg (sonic.net)\u00a0Dracula (1931)Directors: Tod Browning, Karl FreundWriters: Bram Stoker, Hamilton Deane, John L.

More than simply rewriting inclusive histories and expanding the canon, queer approaches to historiography question the very construction of history as a singular, linear, universal experience that undergirds both the creation and the dismantling of empire, nationhood, and heteropatriarchy.

Their conversation oscillates between their work as scholars and researchers in institutional settings as well as their personal and bodily experience within them, grappling with the challenges and opportunities for intervening, altering, and amending archives, museums, and other history-bearing institutions, with the awareness that they are already revisionist accounts of the past. Speaking to individual and communal practices and legacies, they discuss the role of objects and rituals in reckoning with history, narrating counter histories, and the potential for solidarity and liberation across past and ongoing struggles.This event is part of the Vera List Center Forum 2024: Correct* History, please visit here for more information.",

Successful political leaders deploy this form of personal magnetism\u2014which relies on proximity to political tribes and manifests across a variety of media platforms\u2014to appear authentic and accessible in their quest for power.Sonnevend will discuss her book in a conversation with Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, Associate Professor of History at The New School, followed by a Q&A.The etymology of \"charm\" is song and incantation, creating a deep relationship between charm and music.

The poems are sure-footed in their wailing. I was all in from the first poem when I was told \u2018it does not vex me that dead men [walk] through my poems.\u2019 Read this collection to learn the why of it and what it means.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 Lynne ThompsonAjibola Tolase is a Nigerian poet and essayist.

    "title": "Peter Fenves & Susan Shell: Thoughts on Kant\u2019s First Book, which Is Presumed to Have Been a Failure",
    "description": "This paper seeks to show that Kant\u2019s first book, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces, has been almost universally misunderstood. Largely overlooked by scholars of Kantian thought in particular and modern German philosophy in general, the book is generally seen by the few scholars who have looked into it as a failed attempt to solve the so-called vis viva controversy\u2014which had been solved by D\u2019Alembert and Boscovich a few years before Kant set down his \u201cthoughts.\u201d This paper argues, however, that the aim of Kant\u2019s first book does not lie in the resolution of the vis viva controversy and proposes three other aims instead: that Kant was writing something akin to a work of auto-fiction about the strivings of a young scholar; that Kant was seeking the origin of the controversy over \u201cliving forces\u201d in what phenomenologists would later call \u201clived experience\u201d; and that Kant was looking beyond modern-Galilean mechanics toward a meta-mechanics allowed for locally defined violations of force-conservation laws. The locus of all three aims lies in Kant\u2019s curious invention of \u201cintension\u201d as a replacement of Newtonian vis inertia. The larger aim of the paper is to consider whether Kant\u2019s last writings return to the point where he abandoned his first book and fell into his first silent period.Bio:The Joan and Serapta Professor of Literature at Northwestern University, Peter Fenves is a Professor of German, Comparative Literary Studies, and Jewish Studies. He is the author of several books, including Arresting Language\u2014From Leibniz to Benjamin (2001), Late Kant: Toward Another Law of the Earth (2003; translated into German and Spanish), and The Messianic Reduction: Walter Benjamin and the Shape of Time (2011; translated into Spanish). He is also the editor or co-editor of numerous volumes, including Raising the Tone of Philosophy: Late Essays by Kant, Transformative Critique by Derrida (1993), Walter Benjamin, Toward the Critique of Violence: A Critical Edition (2021), and Walter Benjamin, On Goethe (2025).Susan Shell is the author of Kant and the Limits of Autonomy (Harvard University Press, 2009), The Embodiment of Reason: Kant on Spirit, Generation and Community (University of Chicago Press, (1996), The Rights of Reason: A Study of Kant's Philosophy and Politics (University of Toronto Press, 1980). She is also the co-editor (with Robert Faulkner) of America at Risk: Threats to Liberal Self-Government in an Age of Uncertainty (University of Michigan Press, 2009). She has also written on Rousseau, German Idealism, and selected areas of public policy. She has been a Visiting Professor at Harvard University, and received fellowships from The National Endowment for the Humanities, The American Council of Learned Societies, The Bradley Foundation, the Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst and the Radcliffe Institute.",

    "title": "Masterclass with Carlo Muscat",
    "description": "TONE, TIME, TACTIC - A personal approach to creative practiceThis workshop is based on developing a personal approach to practising improvised music. It focuses on the three main areas of sound, time, and technique, and is derived from Muscat's recent book Tone, Time, Tactic. He will share ideas he has used to shape his sound, learn tunes, and understand various aspects of the music. Muscat will also discuss methods for improving overall control and fluidity on wind instruments, which he developed from the teachings of the great saxophonist JD Allen. The methods also apply to other instruments since they are essential for ear training.Carlo MuscatRecognised as one of the most promising voices on the European jazz scene, Carlo Muscat's reputation as a saxophonist, composer, and bandleader has flourished through collaborations with numerous outstanding European musicians. His sixth album, Hymns, received critical acclaim, with a four-star rating from Downbeat Magazine and a spot on their Best Albums of 2023 list. This acknowledgement signalled his artistic development and emerging role in contemporary jazz. The eminent pianist Leo Genovese remarks, \"Carlo's sound and compositions are outstanding, and the interplay between him and the ensemble shows a very deep communication with the tradition of improvising music.\"An inventive improviser overtly embracing a willingness to explore new musical territories, Muscat's discography now includes seven albums as a leader and numerous contributions as a sideman. From his 2014 debut release, The Sound Catalogues, each album has probed a different aspect of his sound and experimented with compositional and stylistic approaches, reflecting his dedication to an ongoing pursuit of his musical vision. World-class pianist Aaron Goldberg says \"Carlo's fine taste is on display throughout\u2212lyrical music with a bounce, refreshing in its conceptual simplicity.\"His seventh album, The Body Is Only Light, was recorded in Kyiv on Sunday 24th March 2024 and is set to be released in October 2024 on the American label ears&eyes Records.",

    "title": "Golden Ages: Hasidic Singers and Cantorial Revival in the Digital Era",
    "description": "A book talk and concert with Dr. Jeremiah Lockwood and Cantor Yoel KohnGolden Ages is an ethnographic study of young singers in the contemporary Brooklyn Hasidic community who base their aesthetic explorations of the culturally intimate space of prayer on the gramophone-era cantorial golden age. Jeremiah Lockwood proposes a view of their work as a nonconforming social practice that calls upon the sounds and structures of Jewish sacred musical heritage to disrupt the aesthetics and power hierarchies of their conservative community, defying institutional authority and pushing at normative boundaries of sacred and secular. Beyond its role as a desirable art form, golden age cantorial music offers aspiring Hasidic singers a form of Jewish cultural productivity in which artistic excellence, maverick outsider status and sacred authority are aligned.In this book event, Lockwood will discuss his new book and accompany one of the singers featured in the study, Yoel Kohn, in a concert of virtuosic and soulful cantorial performance in the early 20th century \"golden age\" cantorial style.",

    "description": "Join the Zolberg Institute for a discussion with Emrah Y\u0131ld\u0131z, author of Zainab's Traffic.\u00a0What is the value\u2014religious, political, economic, or altogether\u00a0social\u2014of getting on a bus in Tehran to embark on an eight-hundred-mile journey across two international borders to the Sayyida Zainab shrine outside Damascus? Under what material conditions can such values be established, reassessed, or transgressed, and by whom?\u00a0Zainab\u2019s Traffic\u00a0provides answers to these questions alongside the socially embedded\u2014and spatially generative\u2014encounters of ritual, mobility, desire, genealogy, and patronage along the route. Whether it is through the study of the spatial politics of saint veneration in Islam, analysis of cross-border gold trade and sanctions, or examination of pilgrims women\u2019s desire for Syrian lingerie accompanying their pleas with the saint in marital matters, the book and this talk develops the idea of visitation as a ritual of mobility across geography, history, and category. Iranian visitors\u2019 experiences on the road to Sayyida Zainab\u2014emerging out of a self-described \u201cpoverty of mobility\u201d\u2014demonstrate the utility of a more capacious anthropological understanding of ritual than our current predicaments allow for. Rather than thinking of ritual as a scripturally canonized manual for pious self-cultivation,\u00a0Zainab\u2019s Traffic\u00a0approaches\u00a0ziyarat\u00a0as a traffic of pilgrims, goods, and ideas across Iran, Turkey, and Syria.",

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Sabeen Ahmed, \"Law and the Colonial Order of Things\"",
    "description": "Abstract: This paper explores the limits of philosophy of law in addressing the prevailing political crises of our time--the dissolution of the so-called \"rules based liberal order\" and the fascist underpinnings of \"Western\" politics--by considering an alternative approach to legal analysis grounded in a Foucauldian conception of nomos. To show how modern law serves to reproduce global inequalities and hierarchies by institutionalizing and naturalizing colonial relations of force, it reconsiders modern law through the framework of power. In doing so, it posits a new reading of modern law as a technology for upholding what An\u00edbal Quijano has called \"the Eurocentered capitalist colonial/modern world power,\" or what we can more simply understand as the colonial order of things.\u00a0Bio: Sabeen Ahmed is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Swarthmore College, where she works in the areas of social and political philosophy, philosophy of race, and anticolonial thought. Her teaching and scholarship take as their starting point the recognition that white supremacy is the defining political and existential problem of modernity, and that the discipline of philosophy has historically been implicated in this imperial reality. Her research and pedagogy are grounded in decolonial, antiracist, and anti-imperial commitments that bring global perspectives and historically marginalized voices to bear the major political (and thus philosophical) questions of our present.",

Little and Kamala Sankaram. The Opera in Concert Double Bill features the New York City premiere of David T. Little\u2019s complete Vinkensport, or The Finch Opera with libretto by Royce Vavrek, and Kamala Sankaram\u2019s The Infinite Energy of Ada Lovelace with libretto by Rob Handel, directed by New School Drama alumna Alison Pogorelc and conducted by Christopher Allen, on Friday, November 8 at 7:30pm and Saturday, November 9 at 2:00pm, at the John L. Tishman Auditorium (63 Fifth Ave.). This event is open to the public and free with registration.\u00a0Vinkensport, or The Finch Opera (2010/2018), composed by David T. Little on a libretto by Royce Vavrek, receives its New York City premiere of the complete work in these performances. Vinkensport is a bitter-sweet comedy in one act, which explores obsession, desire, and the need to prevail, through the frame of an obscure Flemish folk sport, \u201cfinch-sitting\u201d -\u00a0 trained finches race to sing the most \u201csusk-e-wiets\u201d over the course of an hour. As they compete, the joys, sorrows, delusions and all-too-stark realities of their trainers are revealed. The New York Times reports, \u201cVinkensport has an exuberant, rhythmically vibrant score by David T. Little with an infectious opening chorus,\u201d while Opera Magazine writes, \u201cVavrek\u2019s interweaving of the human characters is extremely touching and allows for nice musical counterpoint. Little\u2019s music is tuneful but sophisticated and original.\u201dThe Infinite Energy of Ada Lovelace (2019), composed by Kamala Sankaram with a libretto by Rob Handel, follows Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Lord Byron's daughter, who has been asked to help Charles Babbage with his work on the Difference Engine. She struggles between her work in mathematics and upholding her reputation as a wife, mother, and public figure. The revolutionary concepts that she put forth in her notes about the potential ability of the Engine to carry out an algorithm led Ada to be considered the world\u2019s first computer programmer. ArtsKnoxville writes, \u201cSankaram's deliciously tonal score is loaded with poise and charm that feigns minimalism to suggest binary math, but wanders through some intriguing stylistic territory that has flavors and textures of jazz, blues, classical, and 19th century romanticism, among others.\u201d The Infinite Energy of Ada Lovelace was commissioned by Opera Ithaca and is presented through special arrangement with UIA Talent Agency and Just a Theory Press.\u201cIn 1916 David Mannes hired Ernest Bloch to be the very first composition faculty member at the brand new Mannes School of Music. Fast forward to today, with this program of works by David T. Little and Kamala Sankaram and one cannot miss how the tradition of world class composers teaching and studying at Mannes is stronger than ever. I cannot wait to attend this double bill, with two brilliant composers and colleagues who are a big part of the rapid evolution of opera in the United States,\u201d said Richard Kessler, Executive Dean of the College of Performing Arts and Dean of Mannes School of Music.Under the leadership of Managing Artistic Director Emma Griffin, Mannes Opera is a dynamic training program for operatic artists, marked by a curiosity for new and a devotion to craft.

    "title": "New York City Graduate National Portfolio Day",
    "description": "What are National Portfolio Days?National Portfolio Days are annual events held in multiple locations across the United States, Canada and Europe. They are designed to provide a unique opportunity for you to meet individually with professional representatives of accredited art, design, and architecture colleges and universities. You'll be able to receive valuable feedback and guidance on your visual portfolio before you submit it as part of your admission application. Not all members schools attend each event. Visit nationalportfolioday.org for a complete list of schools attending each event, including November 10 in New York City.No admission decisions or scholarship awards will be offered to you at National Portfolio Days. Some college and university representatives may accept your portfolio as the visual portion of your application. Others have restrictions that prohibit them from making a definitive portfolio decision at the time of your review. All representatives will be happy to discuss their specific programs of study and provide answers to questions about the availability of scholarships and financial aid.You will not find National Portfolio Days to be an examination or competition; the events are about an exchange of information. The representatives want to learn about you, your work, and your post-secondary plans, all while informing you about their college or university and application requirements. These events may be the first time you have been in an environment with so many people in one place who all share a powerful commitment to art and design. Use this as an opportunity to be inspired, to gain advice as to how to improve or present your portfolio and to experience a small taste of what it is like to attend a professional art and design program.What is the National Portfolio Day Association?The National Portfolio Day Association (NPDA) was created in 1978 solely for the organization and planning of National Portfolio Days. The Association consists of representatives that hold regional accreditation and accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), or Substantial Equivalency status. NPDA is the only organization of its kind and the membership represents the highest standard of visual arts education available in the world.What should I bring to a National Portfolio Day?A portfolio of visual artwork that includes your best and most recent work, but it can also include works in progress, sketchbooks and tear sheets. Don\u2019t hesitate to explain how you develop your ideas and where you want to go with them. Often, sharing the process of arriving at the completed work is as valuable as simply presenting finished products. You will hear many different opinions about your work that will be reflective of the admission requirements of each school. Therefore, we urge you to discuss your work with as many colleges/universities as possible and to bring no more than 15 works. Your portfolio can be presented as original work or on screen, but make note wifi may not be available at all locations. Students who are not prepared to show a portfolio may attend to gather information from college/university representatives.All National Portfolio Day events are free and open to the public.",

The success of the modeling relies on a robust numerical method with the corresponding software that can handle the complex geometry, the complex fluid flows and run efficiently on a supercomputer. In this talk, we present a highly parallel domain decomposition method to solve the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a patient-specific artery at the full-body scale from neck to feet. Moreover, a two-level method is introduced to determine the model parameters in the Windkessel outlet boundary condition to guarantee clinically correct flow distributions to 14 major organs/regions. A fully implicit Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method with learning capabilities is used to solve the nonlinear algebraic system at each time step and numerical experiments show that the proposed method is robust with respect to the complex geometry, different model parameters, and is scalable with more than 10,000 processor cores.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBio: X.-C. Cai received his PhD in 1989 from Courant Institute. He was a postdoc during 1989-1990 at Yale University. After about 30 years in the Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder, he recently joined the Department of Mathematics, University of Macau, as a Chair Professor. His research interests are in the areas of large scale scientific computing and computational biomechanics. He is a fellow of SIAM.&lt;/p&gt;",

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/aleksandar-boskovic/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleksandar Bo&amp;scaron;kovi\u0107&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What was common in a Romanian MEP running on the list of Jean Marie Le Pen&amp;rsquo;s Front National (whose seat was probably bought by the Romanian Communist secret services), the mayor of the Slovenian city Murska Sobota in 1930, a Romanian politician in the Banat sitting on the board of directors of a local textile company, and the chairman of the Brasov bar association in the 1930s? All of them were linked to the defunct dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary to the extent that their actual behavior was a function of that imperial past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the research conducted by the team of the ERC-funded Nepostrans (Negotiating post-imperial transitions: from remobilization to nation-state consolidation. A comparative study of local and regional transitions in post-Habsburg East and Central Europe) research project, this talk will highlight the ways individuals who were anything but prominent before 1918 facilitated the persistence of imperial rule in Austria-Hungary&amp;rsquo;s successor states. Using examples from the administration, judiciary, symbolic spaces, ways of doing local politics, and patterns of corruption, Egry argues that practices those figures carried over from Austria-Hungary had their origins in the empire as a management of difference. Thus, these examples reveal a more systemic facet of post-imperial state-building than just ironic stories, they show how seemingly banal social practices helped create the empire from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;",

However, the academic field&amp;rsquo;s shift toward helping a broader swath of society is more recent. Examples of this shift include the surge in user studies aimed directly at assisting studied groups, rather than simply &amp;ldquo;examining&amp;rdquo; them, as well as research focused on making security technologies more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are valuable additions to our work. In this talk, however, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a different approach: What would security research look like if our goal were to shape public policy and help society at large?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will present several pieces of work from across my career, spanning different areas&amp;mdash;cryptography, user studies, and systems research&amp;mdash;that demonstrate that regardless of your sub-discipline, producing research that shapes policy is not only possible, but impactful.&lt;/p&gt;",

Circuit, where many of our most crucial cases are resolved&amp;mdash;or teed up for the Supreme Court. He has championed equal justice for his entire adult life; decided landmark environmental and voting cases; and embodied the ideal of what a great judge should be. Yet he has been blind for the past 50 of his 80-plus years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, he depended upon aides to read texts to him, and more recently, a suite of hi-tech solutions has allowed him to listen to reams of documents at high speeds. At first, he tried to hide his deteriorating vision, and for years, he denied that it had any impact on his career. Only recently, partly thanks to his first-ever guide dog, Vixen, has he come to fully accept his blindness and the role it&amp;#39;s played in his personal and professional lives. His story of fighting for justice over many decades, with and without eyesight, is an inspiration to us all.&lt;/p&gt;",

Did microfinance take a wrong turn, or was it flawed from the beginning? Mara Kardas-Nelson&amp;rsquo;s We Are Not Able to Live in the Sky is about unintended consequences, blind optimism, and the decades-long ramifications of seemingly small policy choices. The book is rooted in the stories of women borrowers in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Their narratives, woven through a deep history of modern international development, are set against the rise of Yunus&amp;rsquo;s vision that tiny loans would &amp;ldquo;put poverty in museums.&amp;rdquo; Kardas-Nelson asks: What is missed with a single, financially focused solution to global inequity that ignores the real drivers of poverty? Who stands to benefit and, more important, who gets left behind?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Backyard Bankers: Immigrants, Savings Clubs and the Persuit of the American Dream&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The essence of money? &amp;nbsp;A quarter of a billion immigrants living in rich countries mobilize and distribute over a half trillion dollars a year in savings circles that they organize and manage themselves. These groups are based on savings traditions honed over generations that have enabled their home villages to build up the reserve of capital that helped them survive. In rich countries immigrants use the savings mobilized in their groups at the lowest level to survive. All this occurs outside the institutional financial system - banks, even credit unions, or government sponsored enterprise development programs - and is based on disciplined savings, mutual accountability, and trust within a context of strong families and unified communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://cglink.me/2e9/r1928008\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;",

But, are these data-driven discoveries reliable? Many such discoveries are made using statistical models or interpretable machine learning techniques, which provide human understandable interpretations of blackbox systems. Unlike for prediction tasks, however, it is difficult to directly test the veracity of ML interpretations. In this talk, we first present findings from a systematic, large-scale empirical reliability study on popular ML interpretations for both supervised and unsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our results reveal that ML interpretations are generally unreliable, and dramatically less reliable than ML predictions. Given these negative findings, we secondly ask: How can we improve the reliability of ML interpretations? We discuss the challenging task of validation for ML interpretations, presenting practical strategies like stability and generalizability as well as approaches to quantify the uncertainty of interpretations through statistical inference. We conclude with several real examples of how to apply such approaches to make reliable discoveries from large-scale biomedical data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Genevera Allen is a Professor of Statistics. She is also an Investigator at the Zuckerman Institute for Mind, Brain, and Behavior and a core faculty member at the the Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics. Prior to this, Dr. Allen spent fourteen years at Rice University in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science; she was also the Founder and served as the Faculty Director of Rice&amp;#39;s data science education center, informally known as the Rice D2K Lab. Dr. Allen&amp;rsquo;s research develops new statistical machine learning tools to help people make reliable discoveries from large and complex data. She is known for her methods and theory work in the areas of unsupervised learning, interpretable machine learning, data integration, graphical models, and high-dimensional statistics. Her work is motivated by solving real scientific problems, especially in the areas of neuroscience and computational biology. Dr. Allen is the recipient of several honors including a National Science Foundation Career Award, Rice University&amp;rsquo;s Duncan Achievement Award for Outstanding Faculty, and in 2014, she was named to the &amp;ldquo;Forbes &amp;rsquo;30 under 30&amp;prime;: Science and Healthcare&amp;rdquo; list. She is also an elected fellow of the American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and International Statistics Institute.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes are responsible for some of the most costly and devastating disasters to impact the USA, as recent events like Hurricane Helene have underscored. While hurricanes play a crucial role in Earth&amp;#39;s climate system, their characteristics are increasingly influenced by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join us on November 13th for a lecture on our current understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is modifying the characteristics of hurricanes. Suzana Camargo will examine both the changes we can already detect in recent years and the projections for the end of the century. The lecture will begin with a brief overview of hurricane science and notable historical cases before analyzing the effects of global warming on these powerful storms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzana Camargo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suzana Camargo is originally from Brazil and has been working at Columbia University since 1999. She is currently the Marie Tharp Lamont Research Professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. She is an expert on the relationship between extreme weather events and climate, in particular, hurricanes and typhoons. She was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2023 in recognition for her research in those topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory seeks fundamental knowledge about the origin, evolution, and future of the natural world.

Despite her fame and importance, for a long time, Shub has been pigeonholed as a compilation filmmaker and rarely studied outside of her early found footage films. This talk seeks to reposition Shub and her contribution to the domain of documentary by exploring her theoretical thought. Shub conceived of documentary cinema not as a fixed category but as something perpetually evolving. She treated her films not as finished works but as a first step in a discursive process. Taking inspiration from Shub herself the talk reframes the idea of documentary film theory and focuses on the questions her films elicited and the conversations they generated. By analyzing Shub&amp;#39;s documentaries in conjunction with her short publications and archival materials about the films&amp;rsquo; production and reception, the talk discusses important theoretical notions explored by Shub in her works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staging Witchcraft Before the Law: Skepticism, Performance as Proof, and Law as Magic in Early Modern Witch Trials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nby Julie Stone Peters&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the judicial machinery of early modern witch-hunting could work with terrifying swiftness, skepticism, and evidentiary barriers often made conviction difficult. Seeking proof strong enough to overcome skepticism, judges and accusers turned to performance, staging &amp;ldquo;acts of Sorcery and Witch-craft manifest to sense.&amp;rdquo; Looking at an array of demonological treatises, pamphlets, documents, and images, this study shows that such staging answered to specific doctrines of proof: catching the criminal &amp;ldquo;in the acte&amp;rdquo;; establishing &amp;ldquo;notoriety of the fact&amp;rdquo;; producing &amp;ldquo;violent presumptions&amp;rdquo; of guilt. But performance sometimes overflowed the demands of doctrine, behaving in unpredictable ways. A detailed examination of two cases &amp;ndash; the 1591 case of the French witch-demoniac Fran&amp;ccedil;oise Fontaine and the 1593 case of John Samuel of Warboys &amp;ndash; suggests the manifold, multilayered ways that evidentiary staging could signify &amp;ndash; as it can still in that conjuring practice we call law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/julie-stone-peters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Stone Peters&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is the H.

Her most recent books are&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Staging Witchcraft Before the Law: Skepticism, Performance as Proof, and Law as Magic in Early Modern Witch Trials&lt;/em&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 2024) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Law as Performance: Theatricality, Spectatorship, and the Making of Law in Ancient, Medieval, and Early Modern Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2022). Previous scholarly publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Theatre of the Book: Print, Text, and Performance in Europe 1480-1880&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2000),&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s Rights, Human Rights: International Feminist Perspectives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(co-edited, Routledge, 1995), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Congreve, the Drama, and the Printed Word&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Stanford University Press, 1990).

However, since it is more of an art talk, it can also be considered under the Performance category with the type of Art Exhibition. In the absence of more information, I've kept it under Academic."

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/valentina-izmirlieva/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The history of the Soviet Union can be defined by periods of atrocity, genocide, and warfare. The Soviet Gulag, the Holocaust, and the civilian and military engagement in World War Two produced unfathomable mass death in sites across the entire USSR for a half-century. Music and sound provide an instant, humanizing, and immersive understanding of these atrocities. In four case studies, Birch will provide examples of how we can hear the Holocaust, the Gulag, Terror, and exile. She will discuss Weinberg&amp;rsquo;s sonic fragment&amp;rsquo;s taken to Tashkent and covertly buried in his violin sonata during a peak of Soviet antisemitism in 1948, sonically describe the Gulag between field recordings of Karlag and the recovered music of Nosyrev and Zaderatsky, look at the overlap between Nazi and Soviet occupation of indigenous space and present Saami recordings as reassertion against epistemicide, and discuss how we can hear the Holocaust in the Soviet context both with recovered music (Tyrmand, Leyvand) and through sound. Finally, where do we go from here? In the wake of renewed Russian expansion and aggression, how do composers like Khanon, Gubaidulina, and Stolyar provide a sonic and intellectual intervention against terror? Rather than an intellectualized view of political violence, music and sound connect us to impossible catastrophe and create an emotional and evocative response to historical events.&lt;/p&gt;",

Her projects have been exhibited internationally and supported by the Graham Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation, the Pulitzer Center, and the Mellon Foundation, among others. She writes about landscape representation, extraction, and the visual narratives of climate change, and has been featured in the New Yorker, the Oxford American, the British Journal of Photography, and National Geographic. She lives in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In South Louisiana, where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, water&amp;mdash;and the history of controlling it&amp;mdash;is omnipresent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Into the Quiet and the Light: Water, Life, and Land Loss in South Louisiana&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;glimpses the vulnerabilities and possibilities of living on the water during an ongoing climate catastrophe and the fallout of the fossil fuel industry&amp;mdash;past, present, and future. The book sustains our physical, mental, and emotional connections to these landscapes through a collection of photographs by Virginia Hanusik. Framing the architecture and infrastructure of South Louisiana with both distance and intimacy, introspection and expansiveness, this work engages new memories, microhistories, anecdotes, and insights from scholars, artists, activists, and practitioners working in the region. Unfolding alongside and in dialogue with Hanusik&amp;rsquo;s photographs, these reflections soberly and hopefully populate images of South Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s built and natural environments, opening up multiple pathways that defy singularity and complicate the disaster-oriented imagery often associated with the region and its people. In staging these meditations on water, life, and land loss, this book invites readers to join both Hanusik and the contributors in reading multiplicity into South Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s water-ruled landscapes. With texts from Richie Blink, Imani Jacqueline Brown, Jessica Dandridge, Rebecca Elliott, Michael Esealuka, T.

NVIDIA experts will lead the session where you will utilize code samples in two main categories to introduce you to Python GPU accelerated computing. First, we will explore drop-in replacements for SciPy and NumPy code through the CuPy library. Second, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover NVIDIA RAPIDS, which provides GPU acceleration for end-to-end data science workloads. We&amp;#39;ll finish with an end-to-end example that incorporates all the tools introduced to tackle a geospatial problem. By the end of the workshop, you&amp;#39;ll have the skills to start accelerating your own Python codes with GPUs!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is organized by &lt;a href=\"https://www.cuit.columbia.edu/rcs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;CUIT Research Computing Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in partnership with NVIDIA.

Maria Stepanova will share her reflections on the creative process. How does the poem reach its readers, in the country of its origin and beyond? What is the role of publishers, editors, translators? What is lost (and gained) in translation? Stepanova&amp;#39;s translators and publishers will speak about their work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What poetic themes, instruments and forms are used in this highly innovative work of literature? How do we attend to the many voices speaking in the poem? How do we relate to its complex intertextual fabric? How do the poem&amp;rsquo;s recurrent imagery and metaphors&amp;mdash;exile, confinement, war&amp;mdash;speak to us about our own experience as we transition from the twentieth to the twenty-first century?

Understanding the drivers of these secular changes is integral to understanding the habitability of planets, feedbacks in the modern carbon cycle, and the evolution of life. By combining the tectonic history of the Paleozoic (541 Ma - 252 Ma) with a coupled model of mineral weathering and the carbon cycle, I show that glaciations can be initiated by enhanced organic carbon burial due to the emplacement and weathering of mafic and ultramafic rocks during ophiolite obduction. Specifically, the high-surface-area smectite clays formed as alteration products of these mafic and ultramafic rocks adsorb organic carbon, protecting the carbon from remineralization and locking it in the lithosphere. This mechanism for global cooling is corroborated by an interrogation of carbon isotope records and whole-rock geochemistry of shales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Earth&amp;#39;s climate has remained habitable for over 3 billion years, Mars&amp;#39; climate cooled catastrophically and irrecoverably. The same smectite clays I propose as drivers of Paleozoic cooling are the most abundant mineral on the Martian surface. In the second half of the talk I&amp;#39;ll discuss recent work which reconciles Mars&amp;#39; climatic history with our understanding of its surface mineralogy, carbon isotopic composition, and estimated loss-to-space of CO2 through time. I show that a substantial reservoir of organic carbon, formed abiotically on early Mars and stored on clay surfaces, is consistent with the available constraints.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;I started as a postdoc at Lamont in September. I use field observations, geochemistry, and computational methods to study how tectonic forces influence climate. I&amp;#39;m originally from Scarborough, England and came stateside for my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree at Princeton and my PhD from MIT.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;When Germany&amp;rsquo;s colonial empire in Africa and Asia collapsed during the First World War, a brief yet incredibly violent regime came to an end for affected societies. In the following decades, they had to fend with the aftermath of the German empire&amp;rsquo;s violent paroxysms, whether in the case of the genocide of the Herero and Nama in Namibia (1904-1908), the Maji Maji War in Tanzania (1905-1907), or other conflicts. At the same time, remembering this particularly violent yet transient colonial regime also became a way for affected societies to formulate demands for and practice self-determination. The talk explores this relationship between memories of colonialism and the making of postcolonial sovereignty based on the example of Herero communities in Namibia between the final years of German rule and the present day: kinship relations, cultural practices, and anti-colonial politics all became theaters of remembrance and sovereignty in which the contours of the present global conjuncture in reparative politics began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fabian Krautwald (PhD) is a comparative historian of modern eastern and southern Africa interested in memories of mass violence, decolonization, and print culture. Krautwald studies the ways in which African societies have defined their relationship to the past and the future, and how these changing relationships affected notions of sovereignty and justice on the continent. He works as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in African History at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*Reception to follow&lt;/p&gt;",

After studying history and visual sociology at the Sorbonne, she began her career as a documentary filmmaker. Her short and medium length films were selected and awarded prizes in several festivals, include &lt;em&gt;Les S&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;galaises et la S&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;gauloise&lt;/em&gt; (2007), &lt;em&gt;La Mort de Danton&lt;/em&gt; (2011), &lt;em&gt;La Permanence&lt;/em&gt; (2016) and &lt;em&gt;Towards Tenderness&lt;/em&gt; (2016), which won the C&amp;eacute;sar for Best Short Film in 2017. Her feature length documentary &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; (2021) won the Best Documentary Award as well as Best Film in the Encounters section at the Berlin Film Festival in 2021. She explained her documentary approach by saying, &amp;ldquo; For 15 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making films from the margins, with a political intention of filming those margins &amp;ndash; the &lt;em&gt;banlieue&lt;/em&gt;, people who have been silenced, because those are the people I come from. That&amp;rsquo;s my territory, my history.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alice Diop made her fiction film debut in 2023 with &lt;em&gt;Saint-Omer&lt;/em&gt;, based on the true story of a Senegalese woman who stood trial for infanticide in France.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Saint-Omer &lt;/em&gt;won her international acclaim as well as two awards at the Venice International Film Festival, and it was France&amp;rsquo;s entry for the best international feature at the Academy Awards in 2023, making Diop the first black woman ever to represent France in the Oscar race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mame-Fatou Niang&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French Studies, the Founder | Director of the Center for Black European Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, and an Artist-in-Residence at Ateliers M&amp;eacute;dicis.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registration by 4pm on November 18, 2024 is REQUIRED for attendance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please join the Harriman Institute for a lecture by &lt;strong&gt;Sergey Konaev&lt;/strong&gt;. Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/lynn-garafola/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynn Garafola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Dr. Konaev considers the shift in Russia&amp;#39;s cultural politics in 2008-2012 from a pro-European, liberal position supportive of contemporary art to its obscurantist opposite--part of Putin&amp;#39;s survival strategy after the 2011 Bolotnaya protests and especially after the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Indeed, it was just after the annexation of Crimea that the Kremlin introduced &amp;ldquo;Fundamentals of State Cultural Policy&amp;rdquo; and determined to build it on the statement &amp;quot;Russia is not Europe.&amp;quot; To facilitate implementation of the new state values (isolationism, militarism, antifeminism, and homophobia), Putin cultural officials started replacing the post-Soviet conception of state funding as an unconditional obligation of the state and reparation for the damage caused in Soviet times with the idea that all funding implies loyalty, thereby making funding a tool used to threaten those perceived as disloyal with imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the decade 2012-22 was marked by intense experimentation with forms, genres, and techniques in Russian ballet, contemporary dance, and opera ; rethinking the notion of theatre and the role of the audience ; the conceptualization, decentralization, and introduction of performative and site-specific practices ; implementing and expanding inclusivity ; and resisting official attempts to impose new state values on the theater community or devalue the professional standing of groups like the Golden Mask National Theatre Award. Dr Konaev analyzes the most significant trends and achievements of this period, as well as the forces of resistance, which the Putin state never underestimated and ultimately treated as an existential threat equating artists with radical terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a planet filled with millions of species, it is only natural to wonder what life would be like as a different animal. Although nonhuman animals can&amp;rsquo;t exactly talk to us about what they&amp;rsquo;re thinking and feeling, scientists have been able to peek into their minds through careful observation and clever experiments. What is it like to experience the world primarily through a sense we don&amp;rsquo;t often focus on, like smell, or through a sense humans don&amp;rsquo;t have at all? How does an animal&amp;rsquo;s perception of its surroundings shape its own sense of self? In this event, three experts come together from cognitive science, neuroscience, and biology to shed light on the rich inner lives of animals and guide us as we step into a completely different world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://barnard.edu/profiles/alexandra-horowitz\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alexandra Horowitz, MS, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Author and Professor, Sr. Research Fellow and Head of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, Columbia University, will begin by leading us on a journey that starts close to home as we venture into the world of dogs. Drawing from her bestselling books, she will share her research studying canine behavior and how dogs lead their lives nose-first, through their exceptional sense of smell. Dogs and their human companions visit her lab where they complete cleverly designed puzzles, games, and tasks, allowing researchers to watch what dogs do and get a glimpse into their mind. How do dogs formulate an understanding of themselves, their people, and our shared world through scent?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nathaniel-sawtell-phd\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nathaniel Sawtell, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Neuroscience and Principal Investigator at Columbia&amp;#39;s Zuckerman Institute, will then take us to a species that appears much more alien: the electric fish. Living in very muddy waters makes seeing with eyes a challenge. However, these fish have a sensory superpower that allows them to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; their environment and each other by sending and detecting electric signals. What is the neural circuitry that allows these fish to process this type of information? By studying the brain and behavior of the electric fish, Dr. Sawtell&amp;rsquo;s research reveals how an animal&amp;rsquo;s sensory world can shape its approach to learning, making decisions, and thriving in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the two talks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://jlzung.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jessica Zung, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Kanzer Postdoctoral Fellow in the the lab of Dr. Gwyneth Card at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Zuckerman Institute, will moderate a discussion and Q&amp;amp;A with the speakers. Audience questions are welcomed, either submitted during registration or live during the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can register &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/snf-brain-insight-lecture-inside-the-lives-and-minds-of-animals-tickets-1043991816627?utm-campaign=social&amp;amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;amp;utm-medium=discovery&amp;amp;utm-term=listing&amp;amp;utm-source=cp&amp;amp;aff=ebdsshcopyurl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This talk is part of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Brain Insight Lecture series, offered free to the public to enhance understanding of the biology of the mind and the complexity of human behavior. The lectures are hosted by Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and supported by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. All registrants will receive a Zoom link to watch the event livestream virtually and a recording of the lecture shortly after the event concludes.&lt;/p&gt;",

Five years later, he moved to Egypt to become the main spokesman of an Arab Sufi reformist movement based in Cairo. Agu&amp;eacute;li- the first to ever coin the word &amp;ldquo;Islamophobia&amp;rdquo;- warned against the European demonization of Islam and believed that a new universal and mystical pact should replace Western modernity. This talk offers a close examination of one of Agu&amp;eacute;li&amp;rsquo;s paintings, &amp;ldquo;Portrait of an Egyptian Woman,&amp;rdquo; and reads it in light of the artist&amp;rsquo;s political affiliation to a Sufi movement that aimed to bring a mystical solution to Western imperialism. By asking whether this is an Orientalist painting, this talk explores the interplay between personal biographies and Orientalism in art historical discourses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;",

The dozens of buildings and projects by legendary architects &amp;ndash; from mid-century titans such as Eero Saarinen and I. M. Pei to contemporary practitioners Deborah Berke and IwamotoScott &amp;ndash; remain integral to its urban fabric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Modern: Architecture; Community; Columbus, Indiana&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;explores Columbus&amp;rsquo;s optimistic program of bold new architecture and landscapes, initiated by the legendary industrialist J. Irwin Miller and local leaders, and the generations-long quest to develop the ideal American city through design excellence. This is the first in-depth history of Columbus, Indiana, demonstrating the unique convergence of civic, industrial, and social forces that produced the pre-eminent laboratory of architectural modernism in the USA. It presents a rich showcase of outstanding, generation-spanning architects and is published in association with Landmark Columbus Foundation, the civic organization behind the progressive preservation and promotion of the city&amp;rsquo;s architectural heritage, as well as the producer of the acclaimed program Exhibit Columbus, a two-year cycle of events that uses the context of Columbus to host conversations around innovative ideas and then commissions site-responsive installations in a free, public exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.phaidon.com/monacelli/architecture/american-modern-architecture-community-columbus-indiana-9781580936125/\"&gt;Learn more about&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Modern: Architecture, Community; Columbus, Indiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/strong&gt;, a Columbus, Indiana native, is an author, editor, and columnist.

This talk discusses an emerging model of generating new chemicals, intermediates, soft matter and energy storage components from biomass. Our continued efforts over two decades in this area have led us to develop new materials from molecules derived from industrial by-products and co-products. The family of new materials generated include molecular gels, solid bilayers, scintillating gels, battery components, liquid crystals, and polymers. Intriguingly, following the principles of green and supramolecular chemistry, we have developed building blocks-to-assembled materials viz environmentally benign antibacterial paints, oil spill recovery materials, energy storage devices, vegetable oil structuring agents and cancer detecting gels. These results will lead to efficient molecular design of supramolecular architectures, soft matter, and next generation multifunctional interfacial chemicals from underutilized plant/crop-based renewable feedstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to download\n\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 28, 2024\nTime:\n12:00 PM \u2014 1:00 PM\nCollege:\nThe City College of New York\nAddress:\nCity College of New York 181 Convent Avenue New York, NY 10031\nManhattan\nBuilding:\nMarshak Building, Room 1027 In-person\nPhone:\n212-650-8402\nAdmission:\nFree, Refreshments will be served.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.ccny.cuny.edu/chemistry",

Using Kamara\u2019s\u00a0body of work, colonial archival documents, and postcolonial knowledge production\u00a0within\u00a0Senegal,\u00a0I make a case for a literary and intellectual-historical approach to the\u00a0field of Islam in Africa.

A philosophical perspective for the contemporary world and for future generations must think of new paradigms of coexistence starting from the living body, a \u201csingular plural\u201d political entity that grounds the community, and from the con-tact between bodies as an expression of the sense of the \u201cin-common\u201d.

    "title": "Sociology Colloquium | Flexible Authoritarianism: Cultivating Ambition and Loyalty in Russia by Anna Schwenck",
    "description": "The Sociology Department at the New School for Social Research presents a talk by Dr. Anna Schwenck of the University of Siegen (Department of Social Sciences) on her award-winning book, Flexible Authoritarianism.\u00a0Winner of the 2024 Mary Douglas Prize for Best Book in the Sociology of Culture, Dr. Schwenck\u2019s book challenges the notion that authoritarianism's transnational rise constitutes a backlash against economic globalization. Describing a governmental approach that simultaneously incentivizes a can-do spirit and suppresses dissent, the book points out resonances between authoritarian and neoliberal ideologies in today's comeback of strongman rule. Drawing on field observations, in-depth interviews, and analyses of video clips, it conveys the look and feel of flexible authoritarianism in Russia through the eyes of up-and-coming youth. The author analyzes ways in which the insignia of cool start-up capitalism and familiar cultural forms such as the summer camp help stabilize the regime, while also showing how up-and-coming youth both embrace and contest loyalty to the government.\u00a0Bio: Anna Schwenck\u2019s research lies at the intersection of cultural and political sociology. She is particularly interested in how cultural understandings, be they transnational or locally specific, shape political behaviour.\u00a0 She studied the resonances between authoritarianism and neoliberalism in Russia, pandemic and science skepticism in German-speaking countries, and processes of re-traditionalization in popular music cultures. Her recent work investigates the role of liberation songs and narratives in conventional and contentious politics in South Africa. \u00a0Anna is employed at the University of Siegen\u2019s department of social sciences and the Siegen-based collaborative research centre \u201cTransformations of the Popular\u201d (SFB 1472). She is also a visiting researcher at the University of the Western Cape\u2019s Anthropology Department in South Africa. She earned a PhD in Sociology and an MA in Social Sciences from Humboldt University Berlin, as well as a BA in Cultural Studies from Viadrina European University, Frankfurt (Oder). She was a visiting student/scholar at University College London's School of Slavonic and East European Studies, the Sociology Department at the University of California (Berkeley), and the Russian State University for the Humanities (Moscow).",

How is change possible in an epoch when everything has to be produced \u201cJust-in-time\u201d? What could the revolution of our time look like? The musical prelude will tell us the story of a society that has decided to apply the principle of accelerated change to all aspects of social life, while the speakers assembled in the reading will speculate about where we might possibly be heading.\u00a0The musical prelude will feature:Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re, concept, musical composition & videoChiara Bottici, libretto and narrationCamilla Hoitenga, flutistMatteo Procuranti, libretto, actor and stage directorTimo Rissanen and Otto Von Busch, costumes.With the special participation of Hoora Abdolreza, Anita Hessam, Marc Lafia, and Ayodamola Okunseinde.\u00a0Speakers will include, among others: Austin Burke, Nancy Fraser, Lydia Goehr, Gwenda-lin Grewal, Lewis Gordon, Ashley Jones, Francesca Romana Recchia-Luciani, Veronica Dakota Padilla, Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Jill Gentile, Nicol Shestani, McKenzie Wark,\u00a0Caro Samaniego-Alberti.",

    "description": "Join Dominic Pettman,\u00a0University Professor of Media and New Humanities, as he launches\u00a0his new book, Telling the Bees: An Interspecies Monologue, in conversation with Elvia Wilk, NSSR Liberal Studies alum and author of Oval\u00a0and Death by Landscape.\u00a0In a bid to wean himself off social media, media scholar and cultural theorist Dominic Pettman decided to revive an ancient custom. He decided to tell the local bees of his thoughts, theories, musings, and meditations. The result was an apian journal that parses the daily news and the routines of modern life in a more sustained and reflective way than the Pavlovian posts to which we are so addicted.The account that emerges from Pettman\u2019s regular discussion with the bees forms a compelling portrait of the tumultuous period running from the Fall of 2019 to New Year\u2019s Eve 2022. What began as a reflection on the traumatic effects of an \u201cunprecedented\u201d presidency soon evolved into a real-time response to the equally extraordinary events of the pandemic and its aftermath.One key concern that emerges from Pettman\u2019s ongoing discussion with the bees is the extent to which, thanks to the alienating effects of neoliberalism, we were already engaged in an advanced form of social distancing long before anyone had heard of COVID. Other key themes include education, human-animal relations, climate change, mediated intimacy, attention ecologies, collective memory, slow violence, the self-fulfilling prophecy that is New York City, the never-ending end of history, and the mundane strategies we share in a bid to forge on, despite the accumulating challenges of the twenty-first century.Telling the Bees is an invitation to rediscover the art of reflection and a profound meditation on human connection, alienation, and our collective yearning for intimacy in an age of distance.",

Wouldn\u2019t you like to be lifted up and out of yourself into a sheer feeling of aliveness, both your life and those of the creatures that surround you?

    "title": "Trajectories of Authoritarianism in Democratic Regimes",
    "description": "In an era of global democratic decline, elected leaders have tapped economic and other grievances and resentments, harnessed new coalitions, and created popular narratives that legitimize the concentration of power in single parties and individuals. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India has compromised the integrity and independence of state institutions, and attacked civil society actors, media, academia, and opposition parties. But national elections earlier this year brought surprising results, with Modi\u2019s party losing its parliamentary majority and now governing through a coalition. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his ruling party were also handed a surprising electoral defeat in local elections in March 2024. Elections in the United States on November 5 for control of the presidency and Congress are among the most closely contested in recent decades, and with the results likely to face legal challenges after Election Day. Through a comparative discussion of India, Turkey, and the United States, this panel will explore how to understand the authoritarian turn, varying modes of repressive governance within democracies and bases of its support, and the channels through which opposition parties and social movements have navigated the fraught political landscape.",

Moderated by&amp;nbsp;Rachel Adams, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How can genetically-incorporated art examine, highlight, and challenge existing social constructs such as the formation of racial identity? This ELSI Friday Forum will explore this question, focusing on the intersection between art and genetics. Panelist, Lucy Kim, Associate Professor in Art and Painting, will discuss a unique process she created to use melanin from genetically-modified bacteria to develop images. This process of screen printing with melanin raises questions about how race is ascribed, its meaning, and connection to something as arbitrary as pigment. Panelist, Paul Vanouse, Professor of Art, will discuss his interactive biomedia installation in which extracted DNA samples &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; through gel electrophoresis to examine the racial identity of his multi-racial family&amp;rsquo;s Jamaican descent. Moderated by Rachel Adams, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, join us as we discuss the intersection between art and genetics.&lt;/p&gt;",

This book demonstrates the extent to which displacement is a deliberate strategy of war, not just a consequence of it. Moving beyond instances of ethnic cleansing, Adam Lichtenheld draws on field research in Uganda and Syria; case studies from Burundi, Indonesia, and Vietnam; and an original dataset of strategic displacement in 166 civil wars to show that armed groups often uproot civilians to sort the targeted population, not to get rid of it. When lacking information about opponents&amp;#39; identities and civilians&amp;#39; loyalties, combatants use human mobility to infer wartime affiliations through &amp;#39;guilt by location.&amp;#39; Different displacement strategies occur in different types of civil wars, with some relying on spatial profiling, rather than ethnic profiling. As displacement reaches record highs, Lichtenheld&amp;#39;s findings have important implications for the study of forced migration and policy responses to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Author Biography:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Lichtenheld is Executive Director of the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University. He has previously worked as a senior researcher at Mercy Corps and a consultant for the UN Refugee Agency, the World Bank, and the US. Agency for International Development. He has designed and evaluated policies and programs on migration and displacement, violence prevention, and conflict resolution with governments, donor agencies, and NGOs around the world. His articles have appeared in a number of academic and policy journals, along with the Washington Post and Foreign Policy. He has a PhD in political science from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch will be provided. Pre-registration Required.&lt;/p&gt;",

This particularly concerns Arctic ozone, as its interactions with the large-scale atmospheric circulation and climate have been largely overlooked. Here, I provide multiple lines of evidence concerning the importance of Arctic ozone and its coupling with climate on a broad range of time-scales, encompassing short-term (i.e. intraseasonal) variability to long-term climate change. First, I will show results on the connection between Arctic ozone and surface climate on interannual time-scales, highlighting the contribution of springtime ozone depletion to surface climate anomalies, and the role of Arctic ozone extremes in modulating the timing of the polar vortex breakdown. Then, I will discuss the effects of long-term ozone recovery on the Arctic stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere coupling; I will show how ozone (super-)recovery significantly offsets the effects of GHGs on the Northern Hemispheric polar vortex, which has implications for regional surface projections. Taken together, there is emerging evidence pointing at a large and previously unrecognized influence of Arctic ozone on Northern Hemispheric (NH) surface climate, and my talk will explore the dynamical and radiative mechanisms behind this connection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Gabriel Chiodo is a tenure-track Research Scientist in climate science &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and group leader &lt;/em&gt;at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid.

What are the remaining implications for the study of religion in our classrooms and civic spaces? In what ways are narratives, dispositions, bodily practices, and material culture overlooked&amp;mdash;and with what consequences for American religion? Join IRCPL for a conversation with scholars and policy practitioners about the pitfalls and possibilities of understanding the category of religion in terms of belief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light refreshments will be provided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free and open to the public. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required. &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdutct0StZNRkGiRHz7SggjjGyRLTyoIxWGbAk17-0969vPWA/viewform\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Please register in advance to reserve your spot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All prospective attendees must register by 4:00PM on Monday, November 11th.

Did microfinance take a wrong turn, or was it flawed from the beginning? Mara Kardas-Nelson&amp;rsquo;s We Are Not Able to Live in the Sky is about unintended consequences, blind optimism, and the decades-long ramifications of seemingly small policy choices. The book is rooted in the stories of women borrowers in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Their narratives, woven through a deep history of modern international development, are set against the rise of Yunus&amp;rsquo;s vision that tiny loans would &amp;ldquo;put poverty in museums.&amp;rdquo; Kardas-Nelson asks: What is missed with a single, financially focused solution to global inequity that ignores the real drivers of poverty? Who stands to benefit and, more important, who gets left behind?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://practicalactionpublishing.com/book/3017/backyard-bankers\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Backyard Bankers: Immigrants, Savings Clubs and the Pursuit of the American Dream&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The essence of money? &amp;nbsp;A quarter of a billion immigrants living in rich countries mobilize and distribute over a half trillion dollars a year in savings circles that they organize and manage themselves. These groups are based on savings traditions honed over generations that have enabled their home villages to build up the reserve of capital that helped them survive. In rich countries immigrants use the savings mobilized in their groups at the lowest level to survive. All this occurs outside the institutional financial system - banks, even credit unions, or government sponsored enterprise development programs - and is based on disciplined savings, mutual accountability, and trust within a context of strong families and unified communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://cglink.me/2e9/r1928008\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;",

Moderated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/mark-andryczyk/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Andryczyk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This talk draws upon two decades of firsthand historiographic and ethnographic engagement by Zychowicz, an American scholar, and her extensive time spent in Ukraine with Ukrainian peers also writing about and participating in global movements for democracy and gender equality since 2005, throughout Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s two revolutions, the onset of the war in 2014, and ongoing large-scale invasion since 2022. The central book featured explores the role of intellectuals and creative communities in conceptualizing notions of belonging, social progress, dissent, and international engagement of institutions, peoples, and places linked to post-revolutionary Kyiv. Gender and women&amp;rsquo;s demonstrations feature significantly in the history of protest across all of Europe and North America since 2000 to the present. Ongoing attacks on Ukraine that have upended the rules-based order across the transatlantic have further entrenched divides between populations mapping other issues onto movements for gender equality, while women&amp;rsquo;s marches have worldwide come to signify broader opposition movements. What, if any, roles do intellectuals and artists have in shaping the languages and possibilities for civil dissent and dialogue amid a violent war? Are international responses to gender inequalities, including complex and nuanced lines of solidarities in wartime still possible as emancipatory and/or liberating from cycles of violence and occupation?&lt;/p&gt;",

People living with HIV have high rates of unmet behavioral health needs, often due a lack of routine behavioral health screening and the presence of barriers that limit timely access to care. Unmet behavioral health needs are associated with poorer HIV care outcomes and can negatively affect people&amp;rsquo;s overall quality of life. She will discuss lessons learned for addressing the continued problems of unmet behavioral health needs among people living with HIV and the implications for reframing community and organizationally engaged implementation science research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;About the Hyman and Sophie Grossbard Lecture in Psychotherapy and Social Work Practice&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Hyman and Sophie Grossbard Lecture in Psychotherapy and Social Work Practice, honoring two committed graduates of the Columbia School of Social Work, addresses and advances the understanding and knowledge base of direct practice and of clinical social work.&lt;/p&gt;",

This event seeks to provide founders with exposure and information to grow their businesses and provide jobseekers and students with content and connections to access the entrepreneurial space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe WIE initiative envisions a world with equal gender representation at every level within the energy sector. Our mission is to elevate women and enhance inclusion within the energy workforce by developing and sharing research, expanding entry into the sector, and supporting professionals.&lt;br /&gt;\nTo expand entry into the sector, WIE hosts events to provide opportunities to connect energy organizations recruiting new talent with those interested in pursuing a career. Our events also feature women who have thrived in particular energy subsectors.

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/alexander-a-cooley/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Cooley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Central Asia has experienced a faster rise in temperature than the global average (IPCC, 2023). As a result, the region is facing an increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as greater aridity, more frequent droughts, glacier melt, and declining agricultural productivity. Additionally, variability in snowfall in mountainous regions worsens environmental and agricultural challenges related to water availability. This complex interaction of factors puts even more pressure on the region&amp;rsquo;s ecosystems and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The presentation will analyze hydropolitical dynamics in Central Asia over the past 30 years, focusing on how the political recognition of climate change impacts and the assessment of future water stress risks have transformed the security landscape. While conflicts previously centered on upstream and downstream countries, the situation has become more complex. Climate change concerns have strengthened the negotiating position of the weaker upstream nations. It is likely that future water agreements will focus on securing guaranteed water volumes in upstream reservoirs (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan). Furthermore, the distribution of water from the Amu Darya will depend on the success of riparian countries&amp;#39; negotiations with Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;",

This session will focus on efforts to balance opening capital markets with&lt;br /&gt;\nmaintaining policy autonomy in two rapidly growing countries: India and Brazil. Both countries&lt;br /&gt;\nare undergoing a transformation of their financial markets and face pressure to sustain&lt;br /&gt;\ninternational competitiveness while achieving domestic development goals. Moreover, the&lt;br /&gt;\nstructure of their financial system is bank - and not market-centered, demanding different&lt;br /&gt;\ngovernance tools than QE and similar tools that have become de rigueur in the Global North.&lt;br /&gt;\nThis session aims to understand the unique challenges facing these emerging markets as they&lt;br /&gt;\ncontinue to integrate into the global economy, and the extent to which their experiences are&lt;br /&gt;\napplicable to other countries in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Anush Kapadia&lt;br /&gt;\nAshank Desai Centre for Policy Studies&lt;br /&gt;\nIndian Institute of Technology Bombay&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFernando Eguren-Martin&lt;br /&gt;\nSPX Capital&lt;br /&gt;\nMacro research division&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/FVAmbDuqbGfFkZzM6\"&gt;Link to Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Various parts of Ukrainian society will need to be rebuilt, including the energy sector, as this is problematic as experts predict that Eastern Europe is approaching another cold winter. Despite this chaos, the Ukrainians have taken steps to enhance their energy security during this uncertain time. Ukraine has integrated its natural gas and electricity markets with Europe, making it less dependent on Russian energy. The Ukrainians are also cutting their usage of fossil fuels, and they are investing in renewable energy. This could see Ukraine become a leader in green energy on the European continent.&lt;/p&gt;",

For perinatal people who use drugs, this&amp;nbsp;period also comes with heightened regulation of bodies and rights in ways that&amp;nbsp;produce, rather than mitigate, harms&amp;nbsp;like&amp;nbsp;overdose. This is thus a&amp;nbsp;missed opportunity to support families and advance health and rights. Here, I present mixed methods data on&amp;nbsp;perinatal substance use and how policies&amp;nbsp;and clinical practices, including provider stigma, play a role in producing harm, but&amp;nbsp;could be altered to better serve this population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooke S. West&lt;/strong&gt; is an Assistant Professor at the Columbia School of Social Work and Faculty Affiliate of the Social Intervention Group (SIG). As a medical sociologist, Dr. West&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on the social, economic, physical and policy factors underlying inequities in health among marginalized and criminalized populations, both globally and domestically. Drawing on both social science and public health approaches, her work centers primarily on the social and structural determinants of substance use and HIV/STI, with newer work examining violence exposure and reproductive health. Dr. West is the principal investigator on a NIDA-funded study that examines the intersection of venue-based risk and networks for substance-using women in Tijuana, Mexico, with the goal of capturing the dynamic and overlapping nature of risk environments and how connections to and movement between places can confer health risks. The integration of place-based and network methods, both of which have wide applicability for addressing health inequities in diverse settings, will inform the development of novel intervention approaches that seek to reshape environments and create safer spaces. Dr. West also works on projects related to overdose among women and the health of women more broadly, including the evaluation and development of sexual and reproductive health programs in Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, and the United States. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Before joining the School of Social Work, Dr. West was an Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) with a dual appointment in the Department of Sociology. Prior to her appointment as an Assistant Professor at UCSD she was a Postdoctoral Fellow on a T32 focused on substance use and infectious diseases. Dr. West received her Ph.D. in Sociomedical Sciences from Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health and her M.A. in Sociology from Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;",

Helton chronicles the work of six key figures: bibliophile Arturo Schomburg, scrapbook maker Alexander Gumby, librarians Virginia Lee and Vivian Harsh, curator Dorothy Porter, and historian L. D. Reddick. Drawing on overlooked sources such as book lists and card catalogs, she reveals the risks collectors took to create Black archives. This book also explores the social life of collecting, highlighting the communities that used these collections from the South Side of Chicago to Roanoke, Virginia. In each case, Helton argues, archiving was alive in the present, a site of intellectual experiment, creative abundance, and political possibility. Offering new ways to understand Black intellectual and literary history,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Scattered and Fugitive Things&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reveals Black collecting as a radical critical tradition that reimagines past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;",

Emerging around 650 BCE and enduring to 350 CE, it offered a means for collaboration among fellow city-states and social bargaining between a community and its elites&amp;mdash;but at what cost?&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Polis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;proposes a panoramic account of the ancient Greek city-state, its diverse forms, and enduring characteristics over the span of a millennium.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this landmark book, John Ma provides a new history of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt;, charting its spread and development into a common denominator for hundreds of communities from the Black Sea to North Africa and from the Near East to Italy. He explores its remarkable achievements as a political form offering community, autonomy, prosperity, public goods, and spaces of social justice for its members. He also reminds us that behind the successes of civic ideology and institutions lie entanglements with domination, empire, and enslavement. Ma&amp;rsquo;s sweeping and multifaceted narrative draws widely on a rich store of historical evidence while weighing in on lively scholarly debates and offering new readings of Aristotle as the great theoretician of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://classics.columbia.edu/john-ma\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ma&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is a Professor of Classics at Columbia University.

His main interests lie in the history of the ancient Greek world and its broader context (including the ancient near-east). Within Greek history, he is particularly interested in the handling of epigraphical and archaeological evidence, historical geography, and the complexities of the Hellenistic world. His research tries to combine philological attentiveness (especially in the case of Greek inscriptions), interpretive awareness (for literary but also documentary evidence), groundedness in materiality and concrete space, and a feeling for legal, social, and economic realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for in-person &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrating-recent-work-by-john-ma-tickets-1001548627907?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for Zoom &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_uzPUXXzITXWNqShgIdTRlw#/registration\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Columbia CryptoEconomics Workshop 2024 (CCE&amp;#39;24)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Economics and incentives are a critical part of the design of modern layer-1 blockchain protocols such as Ethereum. For example, scarce resources like blockspace require careful pricing. Block rewards, transaction fees, and maximal extracted value (MEV) must be shared across the stakeholders in the system, and participants must be incentivized appropriately. Subtle game theory governs the interactions between block builders, block proposers, and end users. Many of these economic and game-theoretic challenges are specific to the blockchain application domain, necessitating new models, new mechanisms, and new analysis frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This two-day workshop will bring together practitioners, researchers, and academics to discuss challenges, recent progress, and opportunities in the economics of blockchain protocols. The workshop will consist of invited keynote presentations, contributed talks, and panel discussions. Specific topics of focus will include, for example, transaction supply chain and block production, MEV, restaking, stake issuance, and layer-2 sequencing and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBriger Family Digital Finance Lab at Columbia Business School&lt;br /&gt;\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University&lt;br /&gt;\nEthereum Foundation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Davide Crapis (Ethereum Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Justin Drake (Ethereum Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ciamac Moallemi (Columbia / Paradigm)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barnab&amp;eacute; Monnot (Ethereum Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mike Neuder (Ethereum Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tim Roughgarden (Columbia / a16z crypto)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmed Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mallesh Pai (Rice University / Consensys)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dan Robinson (Paradigm)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thomas Thiery (Ethereum Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;David Tse (Stanford University / Babylon)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Matt Weinberg (Princeton University)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;More speakers to be announced!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",

Like the U.S., Poland has faced deep political polarization and survived the rule of right-wing authoritarians. After a brutal electoral campaign and the extraordinary mobilization of pro-democratic society, the ruling Law & Justice Party lost its majority last October, changing the landscape of a besieged European democracy.\u00a0The panelists will discuss their project, which was made public before the 2023 Polish elections: the highly collaborative and exciting book Let's Agree on Poland, which gave voice to all sides of the political spectrum. This Polish bestseller is now coming out in English from Oxford University Press.\u00a0Is this the time for an uneasy and controversial institutional compromise\u00a0with the rule of a law-abiding right (or still democratically minded right)?

Through a series of three panels, participants will share insights from their practice to provoke and catalyze a lively discussion.This event also marks the launch of the Just Futures Lab, an initiative at Parsons that supports pedagogical and research-based activities that investigate multiple temporalities and foster speculative approaches in addressing pressing social, ecological, and political issues.\u00a0Participants:Tiago da Cruz Bartholo\u00a0From The New School - Mel Friedling, Vicky Hattam, and Radhika Subramaniam\u00a0Nicolas Baird - Institute of Queer Ecology / AMNHLaura Briscoe - New York Botanical Garden\u00a0Devin Pettigrew - Center for Big Bend Studies\u00a0From Parsons - Rachel Dana, Iz Nettere, Ayo Okunseinde, Daniel Toretsky, and Lorraine CruzCo-organized by:Barbara Adams and Jane Pirone of the research collective, Collective Effervescence.Schedule:9:30 am - 10:00 am Coffee / Bagels10:00 am - 10:15 am Opening Remarks & Welcome10:15 am - 11:30 am Panel #1 - Shifting Landscapes11:45 am - 1:00 pm Panel #2 - Multiple Temporalities1:00 pm - 2:00 pm Lunchbreak2:00 pm - 3:30 pm Panel #3 \u2013 Posthuman Horizons",

    "description": "Abstract:\u00a0\u00a0What is critique? According to the Kantian tradition, it is an investigation of the transcendental conditions for the possibility of thinking and experience. While later critics shifted the focus to material conditions, core metaphysical commitments and procedures of critique remained unchanged. Critique of Critique (Stanford UP, 2023), the subject of this talk, probes critique as an orientation of thought through its historical manifestations from Plato to the Frankfurt school and present-day critical theory. In the process, it asks us to consider what critical thinking is and whether it can assume orientations other than critique.Bio:\u00a0Roy Ben-Shai\u00a0is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Sarah Lawrence College. His recently published book, Critique of Critique\u00a0(Stanford University Press, 2023), is the first volume in a trilogy on the concept of \u201corientation\u201d in critical thought. He is currently working on the second volume, Emancipatory Thinking, or the Art of Thinking Otherwise. He is an NSSR alum (MA Philosophy 2005, PhD Philosophy 2012).",

In a conversation convened by Parsons Housing Justice Lab director Gabriela Rend\u00f3n, Rosenthal and Vilchis will explore the revolutionary movement we need to make our housing, our cities, and the world our home.Rent drives millions into debt, despair, and onto the streets. The social cost of rent is too damn high. Written for anyone fed up with the permanent housing crisis, complicit politicians, and real estate greed,\u00a0Abolish Rent\u00a0dissects our housing system from the perspective of those it immiserates.\u00a0From two co-founders of the largest tenants' union in the country, this deeply reported account of the resurgent tenant movement centers poor and working-class people who are fighting back, staying put, and remaking the city in the process.Authors Tracy Rosenthal and Leonardo Vilchis take us to trilingual strategy meetings, raucous marches against gentrification, and daring eviction defenses where immigrants put their lives on the line.",

    "description": "Does formulating new research methodologies through art make sense today and how can they contribute to social democratization processes facing contemporary challenges?Cultural animation was one of the first methods used in post-1989 Eastern Europe as part of the democratization process that started with the fall of communism in the region. Based on the British perspective of community arts, cultural animation worked with local communities engaging people in cultural/artistic projects, and believing that local involvement is the basis of a democratic society.Today, cultural animators have their own congresses and institutions, the topic is researched and taught in universities, and it receives state funding. However, for over a decade this perspective has been undergoing a theoretical crisis, focusing more on practices than on conceptual development of the perspective. This is accompanied by the crisis of participation in arts. How to strengthen and reformulate the cultural animation methodology, so that it continues to enhance the processes of democratization of culture and does not contribute to social stratification?For the last three years, I have been conducting research on the activities of the creative and research group \"Pracownia\", which is a pioneer of cultural animation in Poland. I engaged artists and scholars in research residencies. Based on my research I developed a new methodology for qualitative research through art, which I called the 6-Moves Methodology. This is a shift from animation understood as engaging in active action to animating a research attitude and critical thinking.Open to New School community members only; must have a @newschool.edu email address to register\u00a0***\u00a0Suggested reading:\u00a0Maja Dobiasz-Krysiak, \"More Than a Photograph: An Analysis of the Photographs of the Interdisciplinary Creative Research Center \u201cPracownia\u201d Using the Six-Moves Typology in Arts-Based Research,\" in: Qualitative Sociology Review.\u00a0",

    "description": "Should the multi-disciplinary field of Forced Migration Studies (FMS) re-orient itself around the concept of \u201cdisplacement\u201d? This short intervention situates this question against the background of the transition from Refugee Studies to FMS, as well as external developments in the realm of protection. It draws attention to how the concept of displacement has become more central to both policy and academic discussion in FMS before considering what difference such a re-orientation might make conceptually, ethically, and politically. It concludes by suggesting that FMS might be conceived as standing between and across two larger fields of enquiry: Migration Studies and Displacement Studies.",

Through a discussion of film and social media, they alert us to relations between old and new media, South Asian and Caribbean contexts, Brown and Black racial intimacies and tensions, and multiple generations and diasporas. This study of media in the wake of enslavement and indenture extends and enriches conversations on race, media, and migration.This event is part of the Speaking of Media talks series hosted by the MA in Media Studies, bringing media scholars, makers, archivists, and artists to campus to share and discuss their work.",

While disruptions in supply chains have been extensively studied, it is imperative to recognize that human behavior changes may also amplify shocks to businesses and amenities that are connected via mobility and lifestyle patterns. In this talk, I will present our data-driven spatial network models to predict the cascades of shocks across cities, and further discuss applications to optimize civil infrastructure systems to achieve urban resilience. I will also discuss my ongoing research on cross-city transfer learning approaches to prepare cities for unprecedented shocks.&lt;/p&gt;",

Contestants from over twenty Filipino organizations in the Filipino Intercollegiate Networking Dialogue&amp;rsquo;s District Three universities (spanning across the New York City and New Jersey area) will participate in a friendly competition, with the intention to explore personal cultural identity and celebrate school and Filipino pride. Last year, we had approximately 1,000 guests in attendance at Lerner Auditorium at Columbia University. We consider it a celebration of Filipino culture and a platform for the talent, charisma, and intelligence of the youth of District III to shine through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our theme this year is &amp;ldquo;kapwa,&amp;rdquo; a Filipino word that roughly translates to &amp;ldquo;kindred.&amp;rdquo; More precisely, it describes the deep connection between human beings, tied together by something stronger and greater than blood or nationality. The concept of kapwa manifests in communities of care, where community members actively work to protect and support one another. It is the driving force behind the Philippines&amp;rsquo; most profound social movements: the Katipunan, the Uni&amp;oacute;n Obrera Democr&amp;aacute;tica Filipina labor protests, the People Power Revolution, and, most recently, in protests against the Jeepney Phaseout and the limitations of Filipino fishing rights in the South China Sea. It is also at the heart of all the everyday ways we care for each other, gestures as seemingly minor as holding a door for someone or simple words of encouragement. Kapwa is the essence of Filipino culture, apparent in both our individual daily lives and in our collective commitment to standing against oppression. We ask our pageant participants and guests to reflect upon the spirit of kapwa throughout this pageant and beyond. How does kapwa manifest within those communities? How do you put kapwa into practice within your communities? As Filipino individuals and organizations, what is our role in our increasingly global community, and how can we best embody kapwa?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

One of the major innovations that globally renowned public pension funds made over the last 20&amp;ndash;30 years has been the increased allocation to alternative investments, including private equity and infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n\u25cf&amp;nbsp;Reasons for the shift toward alternatives. We will explore how they shifted their strategic asset allocation and how this impacted their performance and discuss their challenges in managing alternative assets.&lt;br /&gt;\n\u25cf&amp;nbsp;Rebalance. How often do they adjust their portfolio, including alternatives? When evaluations of alternatives become higher, would that lead them to sell certain alternative assets?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, Research Associate, Center on Japanese Economy and Business (CJEB), Columbia Business School; Adjunct Professor, Johns Hopkins University (SAIS); Former Senior Counselor &amp;ndash; East Asia and Head of Japan/Korea Desk, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moderator:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;David E. Weinstein&lt;/strong&gt;, Director, CJEB; Carl S. Shoup Professor of the Japanese Economy, Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Topics to be discussed:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Students face intense pressure from a young age. In the 2015 OECD PISA study, the share of 15-year-olds in Japan reporting high life satisfaction was the second-lowest among OECD countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Economic challenges prevent many couples from having their desired number of children, making it difficult to reverse the decline in Japan&amp;#39;s total fertility rate, which has fallen to a record low of 1.2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. Japan has a significant gender wage gap and one of the lowest shares of women in management positions, reflecting labor market dualism and discrimination.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. The shrinking population and rising share of elderly in Japan places a substantial burden on young people, who will bear much of the fiscal costs of increasing expenditures on pensions and health and long-term care.&lt;/p&gt;",

Both liquid lead and molten salt are corrosive to most of the structural materials. However, their corrosion mechanisms are different because of their unique chemistries. For example, most of the oxides of steel components are stable in liquid lead but unstable in molten salt. The seminar will discuss their corrosion mechanisms and the corrosion process, and then will analyze the liquid/solid interfacial interactions including material dissolution, oxidation and liquid penetration which results in material corrosion and degradation. The seminar will also discuss how to mitigate the corrosion by controlling the liquid chemistry through active oxygen control for liquid lead, redox potential control for molten salt and salt purification.&lt;/p&gt;",

Livnat leads a multidisciplinary research team that is pursuing novel avenues to tackle fundamental challenges in studying and leveraging multicellular processes as a disease driver and therapeutic modality. Using engineering-based, high-throughput approaches, her laboratory develops &amp;quot;hybrid&amp;quot; platforms across in-vitro/in-vivo/in-silico systems to identify new immunomodulating mechanisms and interventions. Recent work from her lab uncovered previously underappreciated aspects of the anti-tumor immune response and new modalities for immune cell engineering. Before joining Stanford, Livnat was a postdoctoral fellow in Aviv Regev&amp;rsquo;s lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. She was among the first to use single cell genomics to study resistance to immunotherapy directly in patients and subsequently in combination with single cell CRISPR screens. Livnat holds a BSc in Computer Science and Biology and obtained her PhD from Tel Aviv University, where she worked with Eytan Ruppin, studying genetic interactions in cancer. Her work has been supported by the Cancer Research Institute, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance, Schmidt Family Foundation, Rothschild Foundation, Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub initiative, and the National Institute of Health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

To do so, it challenges a psychoanalytic concept &amp;ndash; reparation &amp;ndash; that has become highly valued and ostensibly &amp;quot;innocent&amp;quot; outside psychoanalysis. Repair is limit&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and limit&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Avgi Saketopoulou argues, because it is de-sexualized. Reparation, thus, too often works to bind us to relationships - personal, social, and institutional - that harm us. Enthralled by dialogue, however stale or non-dialogic it may be, the reparative can keep us tied to our circumstance.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis is where &amp;ldquo;exigent sadism&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a concept introduced in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sexuality Beyond Consent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;and stretched further here &amp;ndash; comes in. The psychoanalyticopolitical concept of exigent sadism offers some theoretical architecture regarding the ethical necessity of divesting from harmful relationships/institutions. Leaning on the Marquis de Sade, Jean Laplanche, and Fred Moten, Saketopoulou shows that psychoanalysis&amp;rsquo;s remarkable and unrealized insurgent potential decays when we turn away from the libidinal&amp;mdash;which is how the reparative operates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Traveling through Melanie Klein&amp;rsquo;s introduction of reparation and David Eng&amp;rsquo;s important critique of it, this talk pushes further: to show the role that exigent sadism can play in resisting the ruse that our objects &amp;ndash; whether individuals or institutions &amp;mdash; can save us. The crackdowns on student protests in response to Israel&amp;#39;s genocide in Palestine illuminate these ideas in stark and powerful ways and will be discussed in this context. Ethical sadism is a critical tool for the transformations that our institutions so formidably resist &amp;ndash; and which as individuals, too, we are so often afraid to risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-sponsored by the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society&lt;/p&gt;",

She was born in Guadeloupe on February 11, 1934, and died in Apt, France, on April 2, 2024. Cond&amp;eacute; studied at Universit&amp;eacute; de Paris III and received a doctorate in Comparative Literature. She is the author of 16 novels as well as two memoirs and an important body of literary criticism. Her fiction foregrounds questions of diasporic Caribbean identity and migration, deracination and dislocation, and the ways in which gender intersects with these questions.&amp;nbsp; In recognition of her writing and service to Francophone culture, she was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor in 2014 and received a Grand Croix in the National Order of Merit in 2019. She was awarded the New Academy or &amp;ldquo;Alternative Nobel&amp;rdquo; Prize in Literature&amp;nbsp; in 2018, and shortlisted for the International Booker Prize in 2015 and 2023. Her fiction and criticism alike resonated with both the French-speaking world and international audiences, and helped to reimagine French studies&amp;mdash;once focused on metropolitan French literature&amp;mdash;as a field of Francophone studies that explores writing about and by French-speaking authors from countries and regions around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 1995, Cond&amp;eacute; joined the French Department at Columbia, where she chaired the Center for French and Francophone Studies from its foundation in 1997 to 2002. During her time at Columbia, she trained many students in Francophone literature, and is remembered by her colleagues for her remarkable ability to generate a mix of humor, intellectual rigor, and joy in any room as well as for her hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, December 4, 5:30-8:30 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homage to Maryse Cond&amp;eacute; I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Philcox and Kaiama L.

But the political, Gil Anidjar argues, has always been maternal.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn a series of finely woven meditations on slavery, sovereignty, and the social contract, this book places mothers and mothering at the crux of political thought. Anidjar identifies a maternal sovereignty and a maternal contract, showing that without motherhood, there could be no constitution, preservation, or reproduction of collective existence in time. And maternal power is also power over life and death, as he reveals through a nuanced consideration of abortion.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThrough the concept of the maternal, Anidjar offers new insights into abiding sources from the Bible and ancient Greece to classical and modern political philosophy&amp;mdash;the story of Hagar and Sarah, Oedipus and his two mothers, Hegel&amp;rsquo;s dialectic of master and slave&amp;mdash;reinterpreted in light of Black and feminist criticism, psychoanalytic theory, and autotheoretical reflection. Elegantly written and provocative,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;On the Sovereignty of Mothers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers the maternal as a new frame for understanding the political order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://religion.columbia.edu/content/gil-anidjar\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gil Anidjar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;teaches in the Department of Religion, where his interest in religion and politics, and more specifically in political theology and political philosophy, have guided courses such &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Vampires&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mothers&amp;rdquo; for a number of years now.

In these talks, Daniel Immerwahr and Matthew C. Hunter connect architecture to abundance by describing: the rewards and risks of clear-cutting, quick construction, and town-burning that defined colonial building&amp;rsquo;s attitude to North America&amp;rsquo;s Indigenous forests, and the risk cartography that made insurance underwriting possible, with its surprising ties to the valuation of art.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For in-person attendance (general public welcome): Email&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:buellcenter@columbia.edu\"&gt;buellcenter@columbia.edu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to RSVP.

He is also a contributing writer at The New Yorker. His first book, Thinking Small, offers a critical account of the United States&amp;rsquo; pursuit of grassroots development at home and abroad in the middle of the twentieth century. His second, the bestselling How to Hide an Empire, is a narrative history of the United States with its overseas territory included in the story. Immerwahr is now writing a fire history of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew C.

Despite drawing our attention to the literary education, anglophone authors received while on Ford and Rockefeller fellowships in the United States, which created a demand for successful aesthetic form, Mojares implies that generic differences in the Philippine novel originate in their language of composition&amp;mdash;and more worryingly, that all Philippine anglophone writing is condemned by its colonial relationship of inferiority to the US. Comparing one English novel,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A Season of Grace&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1956) by N.V.M. Gonzalez, with Edgardo M. Reyes&amp;rsquo;s 1986 Tagalog novel&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag (In the Claws of Light)&lt;/em&gt;, this talk attempts to show how the differences between anglophone and Tagalog novels have more to do with different social relations of literary labor. Despite grappling with his own conscription as a neocolonial cultural ambassador, Gonzalez seeks to establish and maintain aesthetic autonomy in spite of his privatized funding. On the other hand, Reyes&amp;mdash;among other Tagalog authors in the 1960s and 70s&amp;mdash;was more interested in literary naturalism as a way to address the increasing proletarianization of the Manila urban workforce in the Marcos era.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;",

The recent book, &lt;em&gt;Quotas: The &amp;ldquo;Jewish Question&amp;rdquo; and Higher Education in Central Europe, 1880-1945&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Michael L. Miller and Judith Szapor, explores the ideologies and practices of quota regimes and the ways quotas have been justified, implemented, challenged, and remembered from the late nineteenth century until the middle of the twentieth century. Miller&amp;#39;s talk will examine the origins of quotas, the moral, legal, and political arguments developed by their supporters and opponents, and the social and personal impact of these attempts to limit access to higher education.&lt;/p&gt;",

How might you advance your own and your students&amp;rsquo;?

Join in conversation with your colleagues around why it&amp;rsquo;s important to foster students&amp;rsquo; AI literacy, and how you might do that within the context of your course and discipline.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Before Apollo reached the Moon, there was Ranger. And it did not land, it crashed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From 1959-65, NASA&amp;#39;s Ranger program was tasked with delivering images of the lunar surface for the upcoming astronaut missions. However, it was only after six failures that Rangers VII-IX finally delivered what NASA needed. With its success, it became the first spacecraft to &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; on a planetary body. This talk delves into the implications of an Earth-based entity&amp;mdash;the Ranger spacecraft and its microbial hitchhikers&amp;mdash;crashing into an extraterrestrial planetary environment of unknown composition. To advise on this interplanetary encounter&amp;mdash;one that could violate NASA&amp;rsquo;s stringent restrictions of biological exchange from one planetary body to another&amp;mdash;a cadre of NASA scientists, US Army Biological Laboratories, and various commercial corporations were called upon. What emerged from their meeting was a reconfiguration of biopower on an interplanetary scale, in which bios was expanded to potentially include non-Earthly life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burton makes space for Ranger&amp;rsquo;s other impacts, involving interplanetary multispecies relations, neoliberal geontopower logics, and prestige politics. The 1960s rendering of life into categories of purity and contagion&amp;mdash;earthly and extraterrestrial&amp;mdash;simultaneously made possible de-centering Earth itself, with material and affective consequences. What becomes of humans, of biology from Earth, when Ranger&amp;rsquo;s immediate success and the future of NASA lunar operations hinges on institutional requirements to eliminate all animate terran life on the spacecraft? The Ranger program&amp;#39;s history provides insights into our current outer space moment, as NASA prepares for the return of human&amp;rsquo;s physical presence to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/dana-burton/\"&gt;Dana Burton&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the New School for Social Research&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dana-burton-life-and-the-nasa-ranger-missions-to-the-moon-registration-976362365117\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the top 20 leading causes of illness-related disability according to the World Health Organization, and often causes significant academic, occupational and family impairment. Exposure and Ritual Prevention (EX/RP) has proven to be an effective therapy for OCD. In EX/RP, a patient is guided in gradually facing feared situations while resisting rituals or compulsions. This workshop will focus on the treatment of OCD using EX/RP. The presenter will briefly review the diagnostic profile of OCD and will cover assessment strategies that help prepare a clinician and patient for EX/RP. Strategies for providing psychoeducation to patients and building willingness to engage in EX/RP will be discussed. The presenter will outline how to develop an exposure-based course of treatment, will review exposure ideas for common OCD symptoms, and will model the use of exposure in various formats. The presentation will also focus on identifying rituals, including mental rituals, and how to guide patients in reducing these behaviors. Attention will be paid to including family members in the treatment process. Finally, the presenter will discuss common barriers to treatment and how to overcome them. Live modeling and role plays will be used throughout the workshop to illustrate EX/RP.&lt;/p&gt;",

Vocalist Dr. Waheedullah Saghar, a master of Afghan and Hindustani music who has performed all over the world, was the head of the Music Department at Kabul University until the Taliban reclaimed control of Afghanistan and will be in residence at The New School during the 2024-25 academic year as part of the New School's University in Exile for Afghan Artists, a consortium in collaboration with the Artistic Freedom Initiative. Dr. Saghar will discuss Afghanistan's now fragile musical heritage and his own extraordinary personal musical journey in the face of adversity with composer and music journalist Frank J. Oteri, Assistant Professor of Musicology at The New School.Dr. Waheedullah Saghar is the former head of Music Department, Faculty of Fine Arts, Kabul University.

Among Oteri's other works are: Fair and Balanced?, a quartertone saxophone quartet premiered and recorded by the PRISM Quartet; Imagined Overtures, for a rock band in 36-tone equal temperament recorded by the Los Angeles Electric 8; the ASCAP Foundation Charles Kingsford Fund commissioned song cycle Versions of the Truth for dual-voiced singer and piano premiered by the Cheah Chan Duo; and the 13-limit just intonation clarinet solo Spurl which was awarded UnTwelve's 2018 Micro-Cosmos (Mikrokosmos) Microtonal Pedagogy Award. In addition to his composing activities, Oteri is the Vice President of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) and the Editor in Chief of its World New Music Magazine. From 1999 to 2023, Oteri was the Editor of NewMusicBox, which was created at the American Music Center and continued at New Music USA.

His innovative system was predicated on novel uses of the minor third fourth progression, which attributed to the expanded use of whole tone scales and the twelve-tone system, giving more flexibility to the improviser.

U.S. hegemony was born out of the challenges of the 20th century. It prevailed in the Cold War in Europe. In the 21st century it is faced with challenges that put in question both its efficacy and its legitimacy at home and abroad. Those questions have been given further urgency by the reelection of Donald Trump.\u00a0This lecture by Columbia historian Adam Tooze will offer an occasion to take stock. This event is part of\u00a0NSSR's endowed\u00a0Hans Maeder Lecture Series. The series was established in honor of Hans Maeder, a leader in progressive eduation and an extraordinary intellectual and political activist who exemplified in his life's work a dedication to international understanding and social justice. Following his death\u00a0in 1988, his former students endowed this lectureship at The New School in 1990.",

Today, David Yurman has become one of America\u2019s foremost luxury jewelry brands, having redefined contemporary jewelry and revolutionized the industry across five decades of celebrated designs and paradigm-shifting collaborations with Peter Lingbergh, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and more. To mark the publication of their new book,\u00a0Sybil and David Yurman:\u00a0Artists and Jewelers\u00a0(Phaidon), the Yurmans reveal their personal story and creative journey together through never-before-published stories and images from their archives.Moderating the discussion will be Frank Everett, Vice Chairman of Jewelry at Sotheby\u2019s.

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Kris Sealey, \"A Caribbean Poetics of Forgetting\"",
    "description": "Abstract:\u00a0I use the conceptual umbrella - A Caribbean Poetics of Forgetting - to think through the temporal and spatial aspects of world-making as it arises out of the Caribbean diaspora. The 'forgetting' in this ethics of forgetting is not a disavowal of multiple axes of violence that found this diaspora. Rather, I attempt to use an ethics of forgetting to name Caribbean practices of clearing that condition something like a Kierkegaardian leap of faith - into a future; toward the miracle work of making roots in blood-soil; and for the work of making a way out of fragmented history/ruptured time. In the main, this exploration is grounded in Dionne Brand's poetic cartography (in Map to the Door of No Return), and Edouard Glissant's twinned account of the oral and the opaque (in Poetics of Relation and Caribbean Discourse).Bio: Kris F Sealey is Professor of Philosophy at Penn State University. She graduated from Spelman College in 2001 with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, and received both her M.A. and Ph.D. in Philosophy from The University of Memphis. Dr. Sealey served as the book review editor of the Journal of French and Francophone Philosophy from 2011 - 2022. From 2018 \u2013 2021, she also directed PIKSI-Rock (Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute), a summer immersion experience at Penn State for under-represented undergraduate students with an interest in pursuing a doctorate in philosophy. Dr. Sealey\u2019s areas of research include Continental Philosophy, Critical Philosophy of Race, Caribbean Philosophy, and decolonial theory. Her first book, Moments of Disruption: Levinas, Sartre and the Question of Transcendence, was published in December 2013 with SUNY Press. Her second book, Creolizing the Nation, published in September 2020 with Northwestern University Press, was awarded the Guill\u00e9n Batista book award by the Caribbean Philosophical Association in 2022.",

Anne Carson\u2019s watershed translation of a death-dance of vengeance and passion is not to be missed, combining contemporary language with the traditional structures and rhetoric of Greek tragedy.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m interested in having the chorus of the women of Argos step out from the chorus into any of the roles to focus on the communal in the performance of this work and explore the idea that any member of a community can be the protagonist of the narrative. Ultimately, Orestes\u00a0should serve what I think is so urgent about the piece right now: these are young people playing out the story of a history of violence that they have inherited from the generations before them.\u201d - Ashley Kelly Tata, director*SDC Member",

    "description": "Hosted by Jose Pedro Bastos Neves,\u00a0Ministry of Finance, Brazil, and Willi Semmler,\u00a0Arnhold Professor of International Cooperation and Development, The New School.Sponsored by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy AnalysisWealth distribution and climate risks are two great challenges of our time. Can a Carbon-based Wealth Tax (CWT) be beneficial for both \u2013 reversing wealth distribution and controlling climate risk? A recently published book by Unurjargal Nyambuu and Willi Semmler, \u201cSustainable Macroeconomics, Climate Risks, and Energy Transitions\u201d provides the background for such a proposal. Bastos and Semmler offer details of a CWT here. They argue that a carbon tax should be levied on carbon-based wealth rather than carbon-intensive goods as the usual carbon tax would suggest -- which is often shown to be regressive. In contrast, the CWT re-corrects wealth distribution and raises revenue that could be used to subsidize the creation of green assets. The CWT is a feasible, effective, and fairer instrument for reducing carbon emissions, and may support a fair transition and control of sovereign debt dynamics.\u00a0Please see the full schedule for the day below.",

Fulmer's imaginative vision for the Ensemble has resulted in collaboration with the world's most renowned and trailblazing composers and performers.\u00a0The 2024-25 concert season will begin with works of Carola Bauckholt, Augusta Read Thomas, Matthew Ricketts, George Lewis, Pierre Boulez, and a world-premiere by Ryan Brideau. The spring edition will include works of Matthias Pintscher, Gyorgy Ligeti, and new works by student composers.\u00a0\"I'm intrigued by diverse programs that represent a wide-ranging collection of musical ideas and stylistic innovation. As an ensemble, we embrace a broad view of the vital landscape of American contemporary music, and contemporary music of the world abroad. As artists, we are responsible for, and should take care of the musical trends of tomorrow - we need to share this unique work as if the ink on the page has been dried for several hundred years...to craft, assemble, and refine a performance so that the canon continues in exponential dimensions. Each performance is malleable, and should chart new territory of performance practice and artistic expression. This is what we do here in MACE...\"\u00a0 -David Fulmer, Director, Conductor, and Curator ",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifteen Years of Measuring Access Network Performance: From Benchmarks to Equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nick Feamster&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe last 15 years have seen significant advances in the area of measuring broadband access networks. In the mid-2000s, measuring access networks was simpler: access networks were typically the throughput bottleneck along an end-to-end path, and access speeds were slower, making it far easier to measure ISP performance and understand the contributions of the access ISP to overall end-to-end performance.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nToday, as access network speeds have increased, performance bottlenecks may lie anywhere along an end-to-end path, complicating performance analysis. Furthermore, higher access throughput has shifted attention to other metrics, such as latency and application performance, which present their own challenges. The increasing importance of the Internet in everyday life has also amplified interest in questions of quality of experience (QoE) and equity of Internet access, adding new research directions to the age-old problems of Internet performance measurements.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis talk narrates a 15-year research arc that starts with simple speed test designs and ends with problems in QoE and equity, which are ultimately geared towards the larger goal of improving the lived experience of Internet users around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAt the core of this work are machine learning models that perform quality inference across diverse services such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and Twitch. These models provide fine-grained predictions, revealing, for instance, that higher Internet speeds often yield only marginal improvements to QoE metrics like startup delay and resolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBio:&lt;br /&gt;\nNick Feamster is the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and the Director of Research at the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago. Previously, he was a full professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University, where he directed the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP). Prior to Princeton, he was a full professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. His research spans many aspects of computer networking and networked systems, with a focus on network operations, network security, and censorship-resistant communication systems. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 2005 and his S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2000 and 2001, respectively. He was an early-stage employee at Looksmart (acquired by AltaVista), where he developed the company&amp;#39;s first web crawler, and at Damballa, where he helped design the company&amp;rsquo;s first botnet-detection algorithm.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNick is an ACM Fellow and has received numerous awards for his contributions to computer networking and cybersecurity, including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) for his work on spam filtering. Other honors include the Technology Review 35 &amp;quot;Top Young Innovators Under 35&amp;quot; award, the ACM SIGCOMM Rising Star Award, a Sloan Research Fellowship, the NSF CAREER award, the IBM Faculty Fellowship, and the IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize. His research papers have received awards at ACM SIGCOMM (on the network-level behavior of spammers), the SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (on measuring web performance bottlenecks), USENIX Security (on circumventing web censorship using Infranet and web cookie analysis), and USENIX Networked Systems Design and Implementation (on fault detection in router configuration and software-defined networking). His seminal work on the Routing Control Platform received the USENIX Test of Time Award for its impact on Software Defined Networking.&lt;/p&gt;",

Are healthcare providers ready for what many are calling &amp;ldquo;The Psychedelic Renaissance&amp;rdquo;? In this grand rounds, Dr. Amy McGuire will explore alternative pathways to access psychedelics in the U.S. and the appropriate role of healthcare gatekeeping. Drawing on her research on psychedelic retreat organizations and experience working with Indigenous communities in South America, Dr. McGuire will examine the potential risks of unregulated psychedelic use and explore what it means to approach psychedelic drug research with epistemic humility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics Grand Rounds&lt;/strong&gt; is a series organized by the &lt;strong&gt;Division of Ethics&lt;/strong&gt; in the Department of Medical Humanities &amp;amp; Ethics.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Biological knowledge is commonly organized in the form of networks or pathways. New network models are continuously generated in model organism and cell system screens including Perturb Seq experiments. To establish relevance of network and pathway models to human phenotypes, we developed a rare variant association test that takes into account network connectivity. We applied the test to blood lipid traits, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and breast cancer phenotypes. Applications to Parkinson disease motivated follow up experimental work showcasing an iterative analysis involving statistical genetics testing and gene editing experiments. We also developed new, well-calibrated statistical methods for prioritizing rare disease genes with de novo recurrence and compound heterozygosity. A new method detects pathways enriched with candidate and known diagnostic genes. These statistical tests use a biologically informed model of human mutation rate along the genome (Roulette).&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Today, researchers are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge about the oceans through contemporary ocean exploration, with millions of dollars in funding available from both public and private sources. While the oft repeated aphorism that we know more about the moon or Mars than we do about the ocean on earth is not exactly true, ocean exploration is challenging. In this event we ask how the interests to understand how oceans work and desires to explore the unknown intersect with the realities of ethics, technology, and funding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scientists are driven by the desire to understand how things work, looking to solve the mysteries of the ocean. They often rely on other experts to make their desires real. Some of the people who make scientific discovery possible are inventors, toolmakers, and logistics experts. In this panel we bring together scientists and other experts who are pushing the edges of what is possible in ocean exploration to discuss the state of ocean science and technology and the ethics of this crucial work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Nick Frearson&lt;/strong&gt; came to the Lamont Earth Observatory within the Earth Institute in 2007 to develop and deploy an Airborne Geophysics system capable of mapping the remotest parts of Antarctica in preparation for the International Polar Year. Nick also set up the Polar Geophysics lab to develop the sensors and systems necessary to carry out the work and today has extended the role of the lab to develop sensors for many aspects of the Earth Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob McCallum&lt;/strong&gt; is a Founding Partner at EYOS. He has planned, managed and led deep submergence expeditions across every ocean, including the Five Deeps Expedition, the multi-year &amp;lsquo;Ring of Fire Expedition,&amp;rsquo; all of the world&amp;rsquo;s 10,000m+ trenches, the world&amp;rsquo;s deepest shipwreck (6500m), RMS Titanic (7 times) and the battleship Bismarck. Rob was the vessel manager of RV Alucia for her successful search for AF447. McCallum is also a founding partner of Yachts for Science and serves as a Trustee to Nekton and Ocean Census.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andreas Thurnherr&lt;/strong&gt; is an observational physical oceanographer interested in a functional understanding of the ocean who is involved with all aspects of oceanographic data collection, analysis and dissemination, including instrument design and construction, organizing and participating in oceanographic cruises, data analysis and publication.

Similarly, a major rationale for ELSI was to address the injustices perpetrated and rationalized by the growing science of human genetics. However, bioethics and ELSI attention to justice issues, especially those affecting marginalized populations, has been lacking. To facilitate a stronger focus on justice, leading bioethics and ELSI scholars have made recommendations for action, calling for greater diversity in the bioethics/ELSI workforce, and reinforcing bioethics education. In this session, we will explore these recommendations in practical terms, discuss how or if they might need to be expanded to address broader types of diversity, and what challenges will be posed to achieving them.&lt;/p&gt;",

For over two hundred years children and adults alike have been enchanted by this classic poem. The visions of sugar plums, stockings hung by the chimney, a sleigh and eight tiny reindeer and of course, St. Nick -&amp;nbsp; with his twinkling eyes and cheeks like roses with a nose like a cherry, he was chubby and plump and looked like an elf -&amp;nbsp; have captured the imagination of people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://dc.alumni.columbia.edu/pamelamccoll\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for a lively and informative presentation as Pamela McColl, historian and the author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twas-Night-History-Classic-Christmas/dp/1927979307\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;Twas the Night: The Art and History of the Classic Christmas Poem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;traces the evolution of the holiday, from which Moore&amp;rsquo;s literary work derives, from antiquity and the celebration of Saturnalia.

This research plays an important role in climate litigation as well as policy-making and regulatory decision-making. For example, courts refer to attribution research when assessing legal obligations with regards to the mitigation of climate change and its harmful impacts. Attribution research is also used to support policy decisions and administrative actions, such as greenhouse gas regulations, adaptation measures, and protections for climate-imperiled species.&amp;nbsp;This conference will further advance collaboration between the scientific, legal and policy-making communities by bringing together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners to share insights on the status of attribution research and its relevance to climate law and policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, January 15th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Cole Trapnell, Associate Professor, Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington. Seminar hosted by Jos&amp;eacute; McFaline-Figueroa. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus).

We lack a detailed understanding of how developing cell types in each organ and tissue depend on developmental signaling pathways. To address this gap in knowledge, we applied highly multiplexed, scalable and temporally controlled in vivo chemical perturbations to comprehensively dissect individual signaling pathways&amp;rsquo; (BMP, FGF, Notch, RA, Shh, TGF-&amp;beta; &amp;amp; Wnt) roles during organogenesis in the zebrafish embryo, allowing us to detect signaling pathway regulation even in very rare cell types. Focusing&lt;br /&gt;\non the development of the pectoral fin, for example, we show how this database leads to novel understandings of cell type specification by intercellular signaling during development. This resource will be widely applicable for investigators wanting to quickly assess the role of the major signaling pathways during the formation of their tissue of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Cole Trapnell is a Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. He received his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland and has formal training in both computational and experimental biology. As a graduate student with Steven Salzberg and Lior Pachter, Dr. Trapnell wrote &amp;ldquo;TopHat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Cufflinks&amp;rdquo;, two widely used tools for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. He also co-developed (with Ben Langmead) the ultrafast short read alignment program &amp;ldquo;Bowtie&amp;rdquo;. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Trapnell augmented his computational work with experimental training focused on analysis of cell differentiation, and developed &amp;ldquo;single-cell trajectory analysis&amp;rdquo;, an approach for studying cell differentiation using single-cell RNA-Seq. Dr. Trapnell&amp;rsquo;s lab has introduced computational tools extracting biological insights from single-cell data, such as &amp;ldquo;Monocle&amp;rdquo;, as well as experimental workflows for ultra- scalable single-cell molecular profiling experiments. The lab has used these tools to explore pancreatic islet development, olfactory neurogenesis, and thyroid hormone-dependent pigmentation, and is currently applying them to dissect the genetic program of zebrafish embryonic development. Dr Trapnell is a recipient of ISCB Overton Prize (2018), NIH Director&amp;rsquo;s New Innovator Award and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (2015), and Damon Runyon Dale F. Frey Award for Breakthrough Scientist (2014).&lt;/p&gt;",

Faculty can incorporate these poll questions into their classes to engage, assess, and guide their students in real time. This workshop combines the cognitive framework Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Taxonomy and the audience response system &lt;a href=\"https://ctl.columbia.edu/ars/\"&gt;Poll Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, which Columbia faculty and students can access. Come ready with one course concept and a few associated questions to work on during this workshop. We will also briefly explore generative AI prompts you can use to draft poll questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;**For this workshop, faculty are expected to have some familiarity with Poll Everywhere. For faculty new to Poll Everywhere, you are encouraged to attend the &lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb71-83f996ef-0183-fc23a146-0000474devents@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\"&gt;Engaging Students with Poll Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; demo preceding this workshop and / or review this short video &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/t4kfZBI34bY\"&gt;Using Poll Everywhere for Engagement and Assessment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of this session, participants should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Describe the different levels of Bloom&amp;rsquo;s taxonomy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Construct / revise a poll question that helps students progress beyond recalling a selected course concept&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to join us for this workshop?

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Mining has always prompted discussions about resource extraction, use, and sustainability. In recent times, the rapidly increasing demand for low-impact metals impelled scholars to seek out new ways to conceptualize questions of human impact on the natural world. This roundtable seeks to contribute to this conversation by bridging seemingly separate mining traditions across different temporal and spatial contexts. Bringing together scholars and activists, the event explores human-nature interactions in early modern Europe, colonial and postcolonial West Africa, and current-day Amazonia. Each contribution will reflect on how focusing on indigenous and local mining tradition intersects with and is challenged by past and current ideas about sustainability, cultural stereotypes about the gendered nature of mining labor, and the incumbent need to build connection between humanities and natural sciences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key topics for discussion include (but are not be limited to): the historical transition from ritual practices of mining rooted in cosmologies of the Earth and minerals to illegal artisanal activities driven by global demand for &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; metals; the intersection of gender and mining, particularly in relation to cultural perception of the Earth as a generative mother; the developments of new methodologies in history, natural sciences, and activism to recover Indigenous knowledge and propose localized solutions in response to the growing demand for &amp;ldquo;rare&amp;rdquo; minerals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The roundtable seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between the humanities and natural sciences, focusing on paths to human-nature relationship that have been forgotten and not taken, but may have essential lessons for environmental and human survival.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://eesc.columbia.edu/content/jennifer-angel-amaya\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jennifer Angel-Amaya&lt;/a&gt;, Graduate Student in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/robyn-davignon.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Robyn d&amp;rsquo;Avignon&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor of History at New York University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gabriele Marcon, Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in Social and Ecnomic History at the University of Vienna&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/directory/pamela-h-smith\"&gt;Pamela Smith&lt;/a&gt;, Seth Low Professor of History and Founding Director of the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mining-ecologies-gender-registration-1101619777409\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

This exhibit in twenty-five panels seeks to provide a &amp;ldquo;lens&amp;rdquo; on a period from circa 1899 to the post- World War II era as prismed through a necessarily very small selection of documentary photographic albums chosen from the hundreds found within the Hoover&amp;rsquo;s archival collections.&lt;/p&gt;",

Through their rich and detailed narrative, we learn not only about the history of the Maasai as they understand it, but also about the relations between politics and Western history; about the untold history of Kenya both pre- and post-nationhood; about why the creation of nation-states is not synonymous with liberation; and about how and why Indigenous approaches to land obstruct global processes of resource extraction.

In this session you will examine how you can unlock the benefits of a culturally diverse research group using inclusive practices and examine the ways the policies, expectations, and behaviors in your lab can promote an inclusive culture. Through facilitated discussions, you will explore strategies you can use to engage in conversations about diversity with mentees and foster a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this session research mentors will:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Examine the potential impact that assumptions, preconceptions, biases, and prejudices bring to the mentor-mentee relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Explore concrete strategies for recognizing, and addressing issues of equity and inclusion in order to foster a sense of belonging.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to join us for this discussion on mentoring?

The musicians convey in their entertaining moderations and, last but not least, their appearance in a dark suit with white sneakers, that the quintet is not only interested in first-class soloists and ensemble sound, but also in the fun of music.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOn their &amp;ldquo;All You Need Is Love&amp;rdquo; Tour 2025, Canadian Brass welcomes the new year with cleverly arranged works by Mozart, Bach, Piazzolla, Rimsky-Korsakov and of course the Beatles.

Are you trying to determine what an independent graduate student or postdoctoral mentee should know and can do at different stages of their academic careers?&lt;/em&gt; Join fellow research mentors for a conversation on what independence is or should be in research in Science and Engineering, led by CTL facilitators trained by the &lt;a href=\"https://cimerproject.org/\"&gt;Center for the Improvement of Mentored Research Experiences&lt;/a&gt; (CIMER).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An important goal in any mentoring relationship is helping the mentee become independent, yet clearly articulating what an independent mentee knows and can do and defining a path to independence can be challenging. Through facilitated discussions and a case study, we will collectively surface strategies that you can integrate into your mentorship practice to build mentee confidence, establish trust, and foster their independence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this session, research mentors will explore how to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define independence, its core elements, and how those elements change over the course of a mentoring relationship.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Employ various strategies to build their mentee confidence, establish trust, and foster independence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to join us for this discussion on mentoring?

In particular, the group are using gene-editing and data science method to study immunological and neurological diseases. Dr. Cong&amp;#39;s work has led to one of the first CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tools for in vivo gene therapy. More recently, his group invented tools for cleavage-free large gene insertion with novel recombination proteins, and developed single-cell tracking approach for studying cancer immunology, enabled by deep learning. Dr. Cong is a recipient of the NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award, Baxter Foundation Faculty Scholar, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News (GEN) Top 10 Under 40, Clinical OMICs Pioneers Under 40, and Clarivate Web of Science Highly Cited Researcher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Do you want to learn strategies to assess and address any lack of understanding your colleagues have used with mentees that have worked well? &lt;/em&gt;Join fellow research mentors for a conversation on ways to assess your mentee&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the discipline, especially of core research concepts, led by CTL facilitators trained by the &lt;a href=\"https://cimerproject.org/\"&gt;Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research&lt;/a&gt; (CIMER).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Determining whether our mentees understand the content and processes of our disciplines is not easy, yet doing so is critical for a productive mentoring relationship. Through facilitated discussions and case studies, we will collectively surface multiple strategies that you can use to identify potential causes for when mentees struggle with understanding and how to address them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this session, research mentors will explore how to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assess their mentees&amp;rsquo; understanding of core concepts and processes, including possible reasons for a lack of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use multiple strategies to enhance mentee understanding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to join us for this discussion on mentoring?

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in incorporating climate justice into your teaching practice? Apply for Climate Wayfinding: Teaching for Climate Healing to experiment with new pedagogical practices to meet the needs of a changing world. Throughout the six meetings and modules, we will explore how to address the emotionality of the climate crisis, incorporate climate content and competencies across the curriculum, infuse ecological values throughout the classroom experience, and make a plan for next steps and implementation. Participants will leave with a fuller understanding of their own climate engagement, a plan for supporting students in theirs, and a climate-informed teaching artifact for their teaching portfolios. In short:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look inward&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; exploring our climate emotions, core motivations, guiding values, and skills and &amp;ldquo;superpowers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look outward&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;exploring climate solutions, accelerators for change, and our unique contexts and communities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look forward &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;exploring our visions of the future and creating a personalized &amp;ldquo;climate compass&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and plan.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This in-person seminar is presented as a learning community in which participants engage with learning materials outside of the session, then come together as a cohort to digest and activate those materials together. Note that this seminar invites participants to share motivations and experiences that can be deeply personal, so please join with an openness to vulnerability and collective care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participants who attend all workshops and complete all assignments will receive a letter from the CTL certifying completion.

Her research team, the JEFworks lab, is interested in understanding the molecular and spatial-contextual factors shaping cellular identity and heterogeneity. She develops machine learning and statistical approaches as open-source software for analyze high-dimensional, single cell and spatially resolved multi-omic data. Focused on understanding the spatial regulatory mechanisms that shape cellular identity and disease progression, Dr. Fan and her lab use cutting-edge imaging and sequencing technologies to characterize the organization cells within tissues. By developing novel computational tools to analyze these complex data sets, Dr. Fan and her lab are advancing our understanding of how cellular heterogeneity contributes to disease pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis. Dr. Fan is also the founder, director, and lead software developer for the non-profit organization CuSTEMized, which provides personalized STEM picture storybooks to encourage young girls to see themselves as scientists. The impact of Dr. Fan&amp;rsquo;s work has been recognized by several awards and honors, including the Forbes 30 Under 30, the Nature Research Award for Inspiring Science, the NSF CAREER Award, and the NIH Maximizing Investigators&amp;rsquo; Research Award.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Lancefield Professor and a professor of mammalian cell biology and development at The Rockefeller University. Elaine Fuchs studies adult stem cells that reside in the skin &amp;ndash; where they come from and how they make and repair tissues. Fuchs and her team explore how stem cells communicate with neighboring cells, including immune cells, and how this changes in response to wounding and pathogens. &amp;nbsp;Working with mice, the team employs classical genetics, RNAi, CRISPR-Cas and high throughput genomic technologies to unravel the pathways that balance stem cell maintenance and differentiation in normal tissue and in wound-repair, and to investigate aberrant routes in aging, inflammation and cancers. Their work is advancing our understanding of tissue regeneration, wound healing and inflammatory disorders as well as malignancy and tumor resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIN-PERSON, HANDS-ON 2-DAY PROGRAM&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Available Dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMonday &amp;amp; Tuesday, July 21 &amp;amp; 22, 2025&lt;br /&gt;\nor&lt;br /&gt;\nThursday &amp;amp; Friday, July 24 &amp;amp; 25, 2025&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAdvances in the use of ultrasonography enhance our ability to better characterize acute kidney injury (AKI) and volume assessment in critically ill patients. The initial approach to AKI differentiates between pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal/obstructive AKI. Pre-renal AKI results from decreased perfusion of the kidney parenchyma. Intrinsic AKI is an insult that progresses to damage of the kidney tubules and/or direct damage to the nephron itself. Post-renal AKI develops from blockage after the kidney collecting system, such as nephrolithiasis, malignancy compressing a ureter, or prostatic hypertrophy. Pre-renal and post-renal injuries can be reversible, but prolonged injury may develop into intrinsic AKI. The rapid diagnosis of pre- and post-renal obstruction can lead to reversal; ultrasonography through high quality imaging is therefore critical for clinical care, and identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD).&amp;nbsp;Assessment of volume status is an essential component to the care of both the critically ill patient and the care of patient with heart and renal failure.&amp;nbsp;Volume resuscitation management is guided by often inaccurate methods, leading to delays in care management decisions. While volume depletion and decreased cardiac output lead to end organ damage and increased morbidity and mortality, so too does fluid overload lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, heart failure, AKI, hepatic congestion, tissue breakdown and impaired bowel function. POCUS offers additional methods of volume assessment through lung imaging to evaluate for interstitial edema and pleural effusions. A focused cardiac evaluation with POCUS can also be helpful for non-cardiologist physicians in identifying left ventricular dysfunction, valvular dysfunction and pericardial effusions. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) enhances ability to characterize acute kidney injury and volume assessment in critically ill patients. Challenges to POCUS training for nephrologists include: relatively new use of POCUS, physicians lack POCUS training, and lack of POCUS in graduate medical education. Our objective is to train nephrologists utilizing a 2-day curriculum that satisfys POCUS certification through the American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Point of care Ultrasound targets acute kidney injury and volume assessment in critically ill patients through POCUS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Identify and train nephrologists utilizing a 2-day curriculum that satisfies POCUS certification through the American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. Discuss and train the uses of POCUS with physicians and graduate medical education students who lack POCUS training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThis course will satisfy&amp;nbsp;the instructional requirements (8 hours CME didactic training, 8 hours CME hands-on course) for the American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology for POCUS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the POCUS application on the ASDIN website for details&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.asdin.org/page/RUSCert\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://www.asdin.org/page/RUSCert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "GORGONA \u2013 Film screening and talk\nLife in a prison in the middle of the sea off the coast of Italy, the last active agricultural penal colony in Europe.\n\n\nLife begins before daybreak on Gorgona, a remote island situated 19 nautical miles off the coast of Livorno, Tuscany. The stables are unlocked, the tractors are set in motion, everyday activities resume in the fields, with the milking of the cows, of the goats and sheep, the maintenance of the roads and buildings. In the bakery, the rolls and focaccias that supply the only store are being prepared as a flock of sheep skirt the rows of vines to reach the pasture.\nThe busy men engrossed in these tasks are the inmates of Gorgona, the last remaining agricultural penal colony still active in Europe. The institution encompasses the entirety of this island, whose sole inhabitants are the inmates, the educators and the prison staff. The only exception is 92-year-old Luisa Citti, the last remaining year-round resident and the direct descendant of one of the families that populated the island in the nineteenth century.\nTo be admitted to this \u201cfive-star penitentiary\u201d, a set of precise requirements is required: no ties to organized crime, no issues of drug addiction, and a final sentence lengthy enough to allow for the re-educational program to be effective.\nThe eye of Tibaldi\u2019s camera leads the viewer into an unfiltered immersion in the lives of five inmates, an observation of their daily routines, of their rapport with one-another and with the educators, and of the challenging path that lies before them, in this reality immersed in breath-taking natural beauty.\nGORGONA\u00a0(Italy, USA | 2022 | 90 min | color) In Italian, Arabian, Albanian with English subtitles\nJoin us for a screening of\u00a0GORGONA, and a talk by director Antonio Tibaldi and members of the crew at the City College of NY, Shepard Hall. 259 Convent Avenue, Rm 291 on Wedneday Dec 11th at 6 pm.

Classes met, deadlines came and went, and semesters receded in memory. The transient nature of our university community creates unique challenges to remembering and interrogating how HIV/AIDS left its mark at The New School, but also to confronting the ways in which it actively shapes the lives of community members today\u2013and will continue to do so. This exhibit highlights assets from The New School Archives and Special Collections that reveal how this community has lived with HIV/AIDS over several decades. New oral histories from diverse members of The New School community are featured in the gallery to add a contemporary lens to the university\u2019s intersections with the crisis.\u00a0Presented by Stan Walden, Exhibit Curator & DesignerTuesday, December 3, 2024 | 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm\u00a0Visual AIDS\u2019 Day With(out) Art Videos + TNS Student PresentationLocation: Kellen Auditorium, 66 5th Ave, Rm 101, New York, NY 10011For Day With(out) Art 2024, Visual AIDS announces Red Reminds Me\u2026, a program of seven videos reflecting the emotional spectrum of living with HIV today. Through the red ribbon and other visuals, HIV and AIDS has been long associated with the color red and its connotations\u2014blood, pain, tragedy, and anger. Red Reminds Me\u2026 invites viewers to consider a complex range of images and feelings surrounding HIV, from eroticism and intimacy, mothering and kinship, luck and chance, memory and haunting.\u00a0Red Reminds Me\u2026 will feature newly commissioned short videos by artists working across the world. For more info about the videos, check out visualaids.org/projects/red-reminds-me.Thursday, December 5, 2024 | 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm\u00a0Revisiting the Archive with Ultra-red (Reception to Follow)Location: Aronson Galleries, 66 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011\u201cSILENT|LISTEN\u201d is a sound and performance art piece first staged by the activist collective Ultra-red in the early 2000s.

Hosts Cotter Christian and Will Fryer will engage in conversation with Stan Walden, Jamie Drake, Ivan Munuera, and Gavin Browning, exploring the profound influence of the AIDS crisis on interiors and interior design. Together, we'll delve into this shared queer history, examining how AIDS shaped the design community of the 1980s, championing spaces of resistance, belonging, and activist housing. The discussion will highlight the generation of design activism that emerged in response to the crisis and the lessons it offers us today. A reception at the Aronson Gallery in the Sheila C. Johnson Gallery will follow.Decorated is a new podcast dedicated to uncovering the rich history of interior design, spotlighting stories and figures rarely acknowledged in academic or mainstream narratives. The first season premiered on October 30th with an episode celebrating the life and work of Parsons alumnus Melvin Dwork. Hosted by Cotter Christian, an Associate Professor of Interior Design at Parsons School of Design, and interior designer Will Fryer, Decorated takes listeners on an engaging journey through iconic eras, overlooked design movements, and the lives of influential yet often unrecognized figures in interior design history.",

    "description": "Open to New School faculty, staff, and students only; must have an @newschool.edu email address to register.\u00a0Black women are 10% of the U.S. female population yet represent 59% of women murdered. Most of those deaths were instances of intimate partner violence, and thus, a form of Black femicide. More pregnant women are murdered than those who die of the top three pregnancy-related complications, yet Black women account for 44.6 percent of all pregnancy-related fatal intimate partner violence in the United States. As well maternal and abortion related deaths are considered a form of \u201cpassive\u201d femicide. Today 57% Black women of reproductive age in the United States live under abortion bans and/or severe abortion restrictions and Black women are three times more likely to die of pregnancy related complications than white women.Despite the above, more people are mobilized in response to the deaths of Black men than those of Black women. Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw understands this asymmetry as being partially rooted in Black women\u2019s lack of \u201cnarrative capital,\u201d and has called on women to \u201cshare their stories\u201d of violence in order to redistribute said capital and occasion greater mobilization. But those who call on Black women to share their stories of private violence must reflect, not only on the complications of sharing publicly these stories of violent intimacy but on how Black political leaders like W. E. B. Du Bois have written spectacular violence, and specifically lynching, into the story of who Blacks are and why they are here. This talk considers the people-making stories of Du Bois alongside Toni Morrison\u2019s stories, the deaths she centers in her work, the ephemeral collectives she sought to build through these stories of intimate violence and death and how she would have the stories shared to argue for an effective method of storytelling to increase mobilization in response to Black women\u2019s deaths.SPEAKERShatema Threadcraft is an Associate Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies, Philosophy and Political Science at Vanderbilt University. She is the author of Intimate Justice: The Black Female Body and the Body Politic (Oxford University Press, 2016), winner of the National Women\u2019s Studies Association\u2019s 2017 Sara A. Whaley Award for the best book on women and labor, the 2017 W.E.B. Du Bois Distinguished Book Award from the National Conference of Black Political Scientists and the 2017 Best Book Award from the American Political Science Association's Race, Ethnicity and Politics Organized Section (Best Book in Race and Political Theory). She was the 2017-2018 Ralph E. and Doris M. Hansmann Member at the Institute for Advanced Study and a Visiting Research Associate in the Department of Political Studies at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 2009- 2012. Her research has been supported by Harvard\u2019s Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History, Princeton\u2019s University Center for Human Values, the Ford Foundation, the American Association of University Women and the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition. Her new book, The Labors of Resurrection: Black Women, Necromancy and Morrisonian Truant Democracy, examines the phenomenon of Black Femicide as well as how Ida B. Wells, Mamie Till Bradley, Clementine Barfield, Barbara Smith, Margaret Prescod and Toni Morrison have confronted disproportionate premature Black death and made transformative democratic interventions in response to those deaths.",

    "title": "Book Talk: The Ecosystem of Exile Politics",
    "description": "Join the Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility for a discussion with Susan Banki, author of recently published The Ecosystem of Exile Politics: Why Proximity and Precarity Matter for Bhutan\u2019s Homeland Activists.The\u00a0Ecosystem\u00a0of Exile Politics\u00a0is one of the very few scholarly examinations of Bhutan\u2019s exiled refugee population, and the activism in which its leaders engaged. It\u2019s been noted for its \u2018rigorous fieldwork, beautiful prose, and conceptual sophistication.\u2019\u00a0The book relays the events in Bhutan that led to the exodus of one-sixth of the population, and then recounts the activism by Bhutan's refugee diaspora that followed in response.\u00a0The book\u2019s research shows that activism functions like a physical ecosystem, in which hubs of activism in different locations interact to pressure the home country.\u00a0For Bhutan's refugee mobilizers, physical proximity offers advantages in Nepal and India, where organizing protests, lobbying, and collecting information about government abuse in Bhutan is aided by being close to the homeland. But in an ecosystem of exile politics, proximity is both a boon and a bane. Sites proximate to Bhutan can be spaces of risk and disempowerment, and refugee activists rarely secure legal, political, and social protection. While distant diasporas in the Global North may not be in precarious situations, they cannot tap into the advantages of proximity. In examining these phenomena,\u00a0The Ecosystem of Exile Politics\u00a0adds to theoretical understandings of exile politics and to empirical research on Bhutan and its refugee population.",

    "description": "Participate in the Decorated podcast\u2019s live-taped episode on the impact of AIDS on the design and decoration community, presented in collaboration with the exhibition AIDS at The New School: What is Remembered?, curated by Stan Walden. Hosts Cotter Christian and Will Fryer will engage in conversation with Stan Walden, Jamie Drake, Ivan Munuera, and Gavin Browning, exploring the profound influence of the AIDS crisis on interiors and interior design. Together, we'll delve into this shared queer history, examining how AIDS shaped the design community of the 1980s, championing spaces of resistance, belonging, and activist housing. The discussion will highlight the generation of design activism that emerged in response to the crisis and the lessons it offers us today. A reception at the Aronson Gallery in the Sheila C. Johnson Gallery will follow.Decorated is a new podcast dedicated to uncovering the rich history of interior design, spotlighting stories and figures rarely acknowledged in academic or mainstream narratives. The first season premiered on October 30th with an episode celebrating the life and work of Parsons alumnus Melvin Dwork. Hosted by Cotter Christian, an Associate Professor of Interior Design at Parsons School of Design, and interior designer Will Fryer, Decorated takes listeners on an engaging journey through iconic eras, overlooked design movements, and the lives of influential yet often unrecognized figures in interior design history.",

    "title": "Mannes Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall Premieres Hailstork and Bauer with Diamond's Symphony No. 2",
    "description": "Presenting the Mannes Orchestra at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully HallConducted by David HayesFeaturing:\u00a0U.S. Premiere of Adolphus Hailstork\u2019s Ndemara\u00a0N.Y.C. Premiere of Marion Bauer's Symphony No. 1\u00a0David Diamond's rarely performed Symphony No. 2For its return to Alice Tully Hall, the Mannes Orchestra presents an evening of pioneering American composers, including the New York City premiere of Marion Bauer\u2019s rarely performed Symphony No. 1, which was composed between 1947 and 1950 but was never performed during the composer\u2019s lifetime; the U.S. premiere of Adolphus Hailstork\u2019s Ndemara; and David Diamond\u2019s Symphony No. 2 \u2013 widely praised as a mid-twentieth century masterwork; it was composed in the midst of World War II and premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1944. Ndemara is the second work by Hailstork to be performed by the Mannes Orchestra in as many years \u2013 the group premiered his lauded work, Survive (Symphony No. 4) in March 2023 at Alice Tully Hall.\u201cA few years ago we made a commitment that the most high profile performances of the Mannes Orchestra would be curated by prioritizing works that we love, were either a world, U.S. or New York premiere, were written by under-recognized composers, and would benefit from a recorded performance. This Tully Hall program, a distinctly American one, animates this commitment in a beautiful and powerful manner, giving life to a work by Marion Bauer that had been waiting to be heard for almost 75 years, as well as the U.S. premiere of a favorite Mannes composer, Adolphus Hailstork. Rounding out this program is a work by David Diamond that rarely appears on programs anymore. As dean, I am proud of this work and hope lots of people will come to hear it,\u201d said Richard Kessler, Executive Dean of the College of Performing Arts and Dean of Mannes School of Music.Composed shortly before her death, Marion Bauer\u2019s Symphony No. 1 was originally scheduled to premiere in 1950. However, due to significant issues on the part of the transcribers while working on Bauer\u2019s score, the piece was not completed in time for its originally scheduled premiere date. The work was nearly forgotten until The Women\u2019s Philharmonic Advocacy (WPA) meticulously prepared an edited score, which they presented to conductor Heather Buchman. Symphony No. 1, structured in three movements, finally received its long-awaited world premiere in 2022. \u201cIt caught my eye because it had a note attached, \u2018has never been performed,\u2019 even though it was composed in 1947-1950,\u201d Buchman said. \u201cMarion Bauer was a significant presence in American classical music in the first half of the 20th century\u2026so the fact that her symphony was never performed seemed an egregious neglect of someone who should be celebrated.\u201dAdolphus Hailstork\u2019s Ndemara is a single-movement nocturne inspired by the star for which it is named \u2013 a prominent star in the summer night sky. Scored for two oboes, two horns, and strings, Ndemara weaves a delicate tapestry of timbres, capturing the serenity of a starlit night and the bittersweet nature of parting. Hailstork says, \u201cIn 2016 I was commissioned to write a piece for 2 horns, 2 oboes and strings to be premiered by a French chamber orchestra. The piece was premiered in Paris in 2017 and then, a few weeks later, in Milan. I was commissioned to write a piece that incorporated an idea related to Africa and the cosmos. All lands or nations have their own interpretation of the stars. That led to my choosing one of the stars interpreted by at least three African tribes as a warning to lovers of the need to end a romantic moment. The bright star Fomalhaut lies in a rather star-poor region and is prominent in the summer sky. It is called Ndemara, \u2018The Sweetheart Star,\u2019 by the Shona. The visibility of this star was supposed to indicate the time for lovers to part before their parents discovered them.\u201dDavid Diamond\u2019s Symphony No. 2 was premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky on October 22, 1944. The symphony unfolds over four movements, each rich in emotional depth and musical innovation. The first movement juxtaposes a sense of tragedy with moments of refined elegance, establishing a compelling emotional landscape. The second movement, a brief scherzo, features what Diamond described as, \u201ca rhythmic figure mockingly tossed back and forth between the cellos and a bassoon,\u201d imbuing it with a playful, almost whimsical character. The third movement revisits the emotional tone of the opening, weaving themes of introspection and resonance. The finale surges forward with a triumphant and exhilarating energy, bringing the symphony to a stirring conclusion.Each of the composers on this program are esteemed in their own right, but they also share bonds across time. Marion Bauer is known as Nadia Boulanger\u2019s first American student. Bauer taught Nadia Boulanger English, and Boulanger gave Bauer lessons in harmony until Bauer returned to the United States in 1907. Bauer composed and published orchestral, chamber, vocal and instrumental music. She was well-regarded as an educator and served on the faculties at New York University and the Juilliard School of Music.Adolphus Hailstork received his Ph.D. in composition from Michigan State University, where he was a student of H. Owen Reed. He had previously studied at the Manhattan School of Music, under Vittorio Giannini and David Diamond, at the American Institute at Fontainebleau with Nadia Boulanger, and at Howard University with Mark Fax. \u200bDr. Hailstork has written numerous works for chorus, solo voice, piano, organ, various chamber ensembles, band, orchestra, and opera.\u00a0Born in 1915 in Rochester, New York, David Diamond earned numerous accolades for his compositions, including three Guggenheim Fellowships, the William Schuman Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986, the Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1991, and a GRAMMY\u00ae nomination for his String Quartet No. 4 from 1951. Diamond was a versatile, adventurous, and prolific composer, writing a total of 20 orchestral works, 29 chamber works, 14 piano works, five vocal works, two wind ensembles and nine concerto works. Beginning in 1973, Diamond was a professor of composition at The Juilliard School for 25 years.MANNES ORCHESTRALed by maestro David Hayes, the Mannes Orchestra is the premiere large ensemble at The New School College of Performing Arts. The orchestra strives to foster the highest level of musicianship by engaging with a wide range of repertoire in a focused, dynamic, and supportive environment that mirrors the culture and practices of professional orchestras. Known for its bold and adventurous programming, the Mannes Orchestra has been hailed by The New York Times as an orchestra whose quality is \u201ca revelation,\u201d and for its \u201cintensity of focus.\u201d The orchestra performs a multitude of concerts each season at venues including Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall, Carnegie Hall, John L. Tishman Auditorium at The New School, and appearances with the Mannes Opera at the Bank Street Theater and the Martha Graham Dance Company at New York City Center.More about the Composers:Renowned composer Adolphus Hailstork has firmly established himself as one of America\u2019s foremost composers, with his works celebrated in performances by prestigious orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. His collaborations with distinguished conductors such as James DePreist, Paul Freeman, Daniel Barenboim, and Kurt Masur have further enriched his storied career. Most recently, in March, Thomas Wilkins conducted Hailstork\u2019s An American Port of Call with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Dr. Hailstork\u2019s prolific body of work spans a diverse range of ensembles, from choral and vocal solo to instrumental chamber, band, orchestral, and operatic compositions. Among his early works are Celebration (1976), Out of the Depths (1977), American Guernica (1983), Consort Piece (1995), and Joshua\u2019s Boots (1999). More recent compositions include Rise for Freedom (2017), Set Me on a Rock (2008), The Gift of the Magi (2009), Zora, We\u2019re Calling You (2011), and Speak of Peace (2013). In addition to his compositional achievements, Dr. Hailstork is highly respected as an educator. His teaching career began with graduate assistantships at Michigan State University (1969-1971), followed by professorships at Youngstown State University in Ohio (1971-1977) and Norfolk State University in Virginia (1977-2000). He currently serves as an Eminent Scholar and Professor of Music at Old Dominion University in Virginia (2000-present), where his contributions continue to inspire the next generation of musicians.\u00a0Marion Eug\u00e9nie Bauer was an influential American composer, educator, writer, and music critic whose work helped shape American music in the early 20th century. A contemporary of Aaron Copland, Bauer was deeply engaged in defining a distinct American musical identity through both her compositions and advocacy. Bauer composed in many different genres, including works for piano, chamber ensembles, symphonic orchestra, solo voice, and vocal ensembles. Her music reflects a rich harmonic language, characterized by dissonance and extended tertian, quartal, and quintal harmonies, though she generally remained within an extended tonal framework, apart from a brief period experimenting with serialism in the 1940s. Bauer\u2019s works were widely performed during her lifetime, with highlights including the New York Philharmonic\u2019s 1947 premiere of Sun Splendor conducted by Leopold Stokowski and a dedicated 1951 concert at New York\u2019s Town Hall. In addition to her compositional achievements, she was a passionate teacher. Her academic career spanned 25 years on the faculty of New York University, where she taught music history and composition from 1926 to 1951. She was also a guest lecturer at Juilliard from 1940 until her passing in 1955. Bauer was a vigorous supporter of new music beyond her own compositions. She co-founded the American Music Guild, the American Music Center, and the American Composer\u2019s Alliance, where she served as a board member. Additionally, she held leadership roles within the League of Composers and the Society for the Publication of American Music, often as the sole woman in these positions.\u00a0Awarded the American National Medal of the Arts in 1995 and the Juilliard Medal at the Juilliard School\u2019s 100th commencement, David Diamond is celebrated as a leading 20th-century American composer. His prolific contributions began in the 1940s with notable works such as Concerto for Two Solo Pianos (1942), String Quartet No.2 (1943), Symphony No. 3 (1945), and Chaconne for Violin and Piano (1948). Diamond also composed the iconic theme for CBS Radio Network\u2019s Hear It Now (1950-51) and See It Now (1951-58). From 1951 to 1965, Diamond taught in Europe as a Fulbright Professor. Soon after returning to the United States in 1965, the New York Philharmonic performed his Symphony No.5 under Leonard Bernstein and his Piano Concerto, which Diamond himself conducted. Diamond taught at the Manhattan School of Music (1965-67), earning the Rheta Sosland Chamber Music Prize for his String Quartet No. 8. In 1973, he joined The Juilliard School\u2019s faculty, dedicating 25 years to teaching composition. His achievements were further recognized with awards such as the William Schuman Lifetime Achievement Award, the Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Edward MacDowell Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement. In celebration of its 150th anniversary, the New York Philharmonic performed his Symphony No.11, affirming Diamond\u2019s enduring impact on American music. \u00a0***FREE FORTHE NEW SCHOOL STUDENTS, STAFF AND FACULTYBRING THE NEW SCHOOL I.D.

    "title": "Sandbox Percussion Presents BLOOM by Michael Torke",
    "description": "JOIN US FOR THE CONCERT WORLD PREMIERE OF MICHAEL TORKE'S BLOOMWRITTEN FOR SANDBOX PERCUSSION, ENSEMBLE-IN-RESIDENCE AT THE MANNES SCHOOL OF MUSIC Free with registration / space is limitedSandbox Percussion, a Brooklyn-based percussion ensemble of established leaders in contemporary art music, has teamed up with the acclaimed composer Michael Torke for BLOOM, a new piece composed for the group. BLOOM uses a series of interlocking rhythms that create a groove when played together, using each player\u2019s drums (non-pitched instruments), and vibraphone and marimbas (pitched). \u201cJust as shoots of plants push through dirt erupting in blooms, the vibes and marimbas burst forth from the drums,\u201d writes Torke in his program notes. \u201cIn other words, this music has an organic profile, unlike other recent pieces of mine.\u201dBLOOM is structured in three sets \u2014 Bloom 1, Bloom 2, and Bloom 3 \u2014 each divided into three movements: \u201cmorning,\u201d \u201cnoon,\u201d and \u201cnight.\u201d Two slower movements, Stem 1 and Stem 2, are interspersed between the Bloom sets. The drums represent the earth out of which the shoots grow, which in turn are represented by the mallet instruments. Much of Torke\u2019s music has a rhythmic profile, a physical pulse through which he takes classic minimalism to new expressive spheres, also influenced by neoclassicism and a strong sense of color. \u201cMichael uses rhythm in his music in an intrinsic way,\u201d says Rosenbaum, who previously recorded percussion parts for Torke\u2019s albums PSALMS AND CANTICLES, TIME, and UNSEEN, which led to the collaboration with the full group. \u201cAlmost as soon as I started playing his music, I had the feeling that Michael and Sandbox would be a good match,\u201d Rosenbaum adds. \u201cRhythms are the building blocks of the structure of many of his pieces, driving forward the emotion and the energy. It\u2019s inspiring to find a composer who uses rhythm in a new and innovative way; we learned a lot from Michael and from this piece about how to \u2018melodicize\u2019 a rhythm.\u201d \u201cHe also challenged us technically: In some of the more complicated parts, Michael asks us each to create a composite melody that is split between our keyboard percussion instruments and drums \u2014 that\u2019s a particular challenge we had never encountered before.\u201dAlthough Torke usually includes a colorful array of percussion instruments in his orchestral and chamber works \u2014 tambourine, claves, cymbals, tubular bells, glockenspiel, xylophone, and vibraphone, among many others \u2014 and in 2001 composed a percussion concerto, Rapture, BLOOM is his first piece for percussion quartet alone.\u201cNo group I\u2019ve worked with is as committed, both to their artistry in general and to the specific project at hand, as Sandbox Percussion,\u201d says Torke. The group first saw the work in progress in November 2023, and by May 2024 had learned and recorded the completed piece. \u201cIt turns out that the kind of music I write is the kind of music they do very well, so it is an optimal match.\u201d \u201cMy endeavor is to carve out a place in the musical real estate \u2014 to find an expression that is unique enough to take up space in the repertory,\u201d Torke adds. \u201cWhether I succeed, time will bethe judge.\u201dThe world-premiere recording of BLOOM on Ecstatic Records is available on all major streaming platforms. Physical copies of the full album will be available on October 18. Sandbox Percussion commissioned music videos from past collaborator Michael McQuilken. \u201cBloom 2, morning,\u201d is out now. Watch HERE.

    "title": "Politics Department Seminar | Pre-emptive Violence: Property, Possession and Racial Kinship",
    "description": "Open to New School faculty, staff, and students only; must have an @newschool.edu email address to register.In this lecture,\u00a0I explore the centrality of what she terms pre-emptive legal violence to colonial forms of dispossession and domination. I do this by examining the land law doctrine of pre-emption as it operated in North America in the latter half of the 19th century. As a doctrine that was central to the appropriation of Indigenous lands and the creation of markets in private property, pre-emption has received less critical attention than other legal justifications for colonialism, namely the doctrines of discovery and conquest. Addressing pre-emption, a colonial juridical innovation, compels us to challenge several aspects of the political divide between public and private forms of power and holds explanatory value for understanding contemporary political struggles for control over space and nation conceived of as property and territory.More specifically,\u00a0I aim to examine two aspects of pre-emption. First, through the metabolization of an early international law doctrine into domestic land law, pre-emption imported a legal form that constitutively binds public to private, and individual to state forms of sovereign power. Second, pre-emption presupposed a relationship between individual settlers and the nascent colonial state, which, within the theological and racial frameworks of colonial property relations is best described in the (philosophical-anthropological) language of kinship.The land law of pre-emption assumed an a priori relation between individual white settlers and the colonial racial state, a kinship relation that was rooted in a theological and political-economic form of private property ownership and remains necessary for the maintenance of contemporary colonial land relations. Pre-emptive legal violence, I will argue, does not simply mark the origin of colonial relations and forms of rule, but continues to reproduce them.SPEAKERBrenna Bhandar is Associate Professor of Law at the University of British Columbia, located on the unceded and ancestral lands of the x\u02b7m\u0259\u03b8k\u02b7\u0259y\u0313\u0259m (Musqueam First Nation).

With poignant, lyrical prose, cultural commentator Irvin Weathersby confronts the inescapable specter of white supremacy in our open spaces and contemplates what it means to bear witness to sites of lasting racial trauma.Weathersby takes us from the streets of his childhood in New Orleans\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward to the Whitney Plantation; from the graffitied pedestals of Confederate statues lining Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, to the location of a racist terror attack in Charlottesville; from the site of the Wounded Knee massacre in South Dakota to a Kara Walker art installation at a former sugar factory in Brooklyn, New York. Along the way, he challenges the creation myths embedded in America\u2019s landmarks and meets artists, curators, and city planners doing the same. Urgent and unflinchingly intimate, In Open Contempt offers a hopeful reimagining of the spaces we share in order to honor our nation\u2019s true history, encouraging us to make room for love as a way to heal and treat each other more humanely.",

Composer and conductor David Fulmer has been directing the Ensemble since 2016, and has presented a kaleidoscopic lens of different aesthetics and styles, while exploring diverse musical programs of established 20th and 21st century masterpieces, together with presentations of newly commissioned works and premieres.\u00a0This season's artistic curation and programming includes four innovative initiatives for the Ensemble; a two-year composer-in-focus workshop, collaboration and integration with the Vocal Performance Department, student composer commissioning projects, and collaboration with the International Contemporary Ensemble and JACK Quartet. Fulmer's imaginative vision for the Ensemble has resulted in collaboration with the world's most renowned and trailblazing composers and performers.\u00a0The 2024-25 concert season will begin with works of Carola Bauckholt, Augusta Read Thomas, Matthew Ricketts, George Lewis, Pierre Boulez, and a world-premiere by Ryan Brideau. The spring edition will include works of Matthias Pintscher, Gyorgy Ligeti, and new works by student composers.\u00a0\"I'm intrigued by diverse programs that represent a wide-ranging collection of musical ideas and stylistic innovation. As an ensemble, we embrace a broad view of the vital landscape of American contemporary music, and contemporary music of the world abroad. As artists, we are responsible for, and should take care of the musical trends of tomorrow - we need to share this unique work as if the ink on the page has been dried for several hundred years...to craft, assemble, and refine a performance so that the canon continues in exponential dimensions. Each performance is malleable, and should chart new territory of performance practice and artistic expression. This is what we do here in MACE...\"\u00a0\u00a0 -David Fulmer, Director, Conductor, and Curator ",

    "description": "The Mannes Orchestra, led by conductor David Hayes, brings a program featuring Mannes Ensemble-in-Residence Sandbox Percussion performing Viet Cuong\u2019s Re(new)al, to Alice Tully Hall. The piece, which is dedicated to Sandbox Percussion, is inspired by renewable energy initiatives. Cuong writes, \u201cRe(new)al is a percussion quartet concerto that is similarly devoted to finding unexpected ways to breathe new life into traditional ideas, and the solo quartet therefore performs on several \u2018found\u2019 instruments, including crystal glasses and compressed air cans. And while the piece also features more traditional instruments, such as snare drum and vibraphone, I looked for ways to either alter their sounds or find new ways to play them. For instance, a single snare drum is played by all four members of the quartet, and certain notes of the vibraphone are prepared with aluminum foil to recreate sounds found in electronic music. The entire piece was conceived in this way.\u201d The concert also features John Zorn\u2019s violin concerto, Contes de F\u00e9es, performed by Stefan Jackiw. Composed in 1999 at the turn of the millennium, Contes de F\u00e9es is one of Zorn\u2019s classical masterworks. Building on this season\u2019s theme of exploring the radical orchestra \u2013 unusual orchestrations and non-standard symphonic structures \u2013 the program includes Luciano Berio\u2019s Sinfonia, which includes eight amplified singers embedded within the orchestra.

    "description": "(Un)Silent Film presents Safety Last! - an American silent romantic-comedy film from 1923 starring Harold Lloyd, and produced by Hal Roach, and Kid Auto Races [at Venice], also known as The Pest, a 1914 American film starring Charlie Chaplin. Come join us to see the iconic shot of Lloyd hanging from the clock (Safety Last!), and the pivotal moment in cinema where the camera breaks the fourth wall as Chaplin plays spectator at a \"pushcar\" race in Venice (Kid Auto Races)! Mannes' UnSilent orchestra brings these scores to life in live performances as the audience can marvel at both film and music in real-time. With extra attention being paid to phrase structure, articulation, and temporal coordination, the music leaps off the page in ecstatic delight as it meets the exuberance and humor of the film screen. The scores are exquisitely composed by Carl Davis, a dear long-time friend of The New School. Conducted by David Fulmer.The (Un)Silent Film series has been critical in advancing the resurgence of film screenings with live music and has been hosted by Matthew Broderick, Bill Irwin, Rob Bartlett, Ed Rothstein, and Michael Bacon. (Un)Silent Film nights have presented the world premieres of works composed for The Birds and The Immigrant (by Nathan Kamal and Alexis Cuadrado respectively), a New York premiere of a score by Hollywood composer Craig Marks for the film Sherlock, Jr., and Charlie Chaplin's original scores for Gold Rush and other Chaplin classics. The most recent (Un)Silent presented the world premiere of a new score to the iconic film, METROPOLIS, composed by Mannes student, Amir Sanjari.Free with registration.",
