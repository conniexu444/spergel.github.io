But now that idea&amp;mdash;originalism&amp;mdash;has been embraced by a Supreme Court stacked with reactionaries hellbent on turning back the clock on civil rights. Madiba K. Dennie&amp;rsquo;s debut book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Originalism Trap: How Extremists Stole the Constitution and How We the People Can Take It Back&lt;/em&gt;, ditches the so-called &amp;ldquo;originalist&amp;rdquo; model of constitutional interpretation and the rights rollback that comes with it for something new and improved that works for all of us. Seamlessly blending scholarship with sass, Dennie&amp;rsquo;s book is for law-people and laypeople alike. Rigorous yet readable, fierce and fun, this book will galvanize readers to reclaim the Constitution from an extremist Supreme Court and strive towards the ideals of democracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Originalism Trap&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is more than a takedown.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Rubrics are an evidence-based tool for bringing structure, clarity, and fairness to evaluations for admissions, hiring, grading, fellowship and awards. Like all tools, though, how they are designed and put to use matters much for the outcomes that can be expected. As part of developing equity-minded selection systems, this workshop offers an opportunity to delve into best practices for developing rubrics, how to avoid symbolic adoption when implementing them, and ways to refine rubrics that may be already in use. Activities are designed to aid departments in ensuring alignment with both the current legal landscape and organizational values, and connect to other elements of selection processes such as the application. Participants are asked to bring existing rubrics for review, improvement, and discussion. Participants without an existing rubric will work to imagine what a rubric for their program can look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEARNING OBJECTIVES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThrough participating in this workshop, attendees will have the knowledge and skills to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Articulate the benefits of rubrics and distinguish them from other types of evaluation protocols&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assess the quality of existing evaluation rubrics or develop one for the first time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure alignment of rubrics with the legal landscape and organizational values&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anticipate and avoid symbolic adoption&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Connect their evaluation rubric to other elements of the selection system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACILITATOR BIOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Julie Posselt &lt;/strong&gt;(she/her) is Associate Dean of the Graduate School and Professor of Education at the University of Southern California. Posselt is an expert on organizational behavior affecting access to and equity in higher education, especially in graduate education and STEM disciplines. She is PI and Director of the Equity in Graduate Education Consortium and Director of the Research Hub for the NSF-INCLUDES Alliance: Inclusive Graduate Education Network (IGEN). Her most recent book is Equity in Science: Representation, Culture, and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Damian O. Elias&lt;/strong&gt; is an Associate Professor in the Departmental of Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management at the University of California, Berkeley. Elias&amp;rsquo; research focuses on the mechanisms that guide animal behavior and how these mechanisms relate to behavioral adaptation and evolution. Elias received his PhD in 2005 from Cornell University in Neurobiology and Behavior. His work covers a variety of topics (communication, mate choice, species diversification) across animal systems (ranging from spiders to birds) and scales (ranging from physics to phylogenetics). By studying the diversity of animal behavior through multiple lenses, Elias&amp;rsquo; work aims to explore both biological principles and how bias influences the study and interpretation of animal behavior. Elias is a California Academy of Sciences Fellow and Affiliated Faculty in the Essig Museum of Entomology at UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://usc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwldemspz8uHtcbLHhpq10cDVXLX-6ale3b\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This session is part of the&amp;nbsp;Equitable Selection Systems track through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://equitygraded.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Equity in Graduate Education Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;, which&amp;nbsp;advances equity in graduate education by conducting and translating research that is inspired by community needs, and offering high-quality, evidence-based professional development that provides faculty and administrators with tools and resources to create and sustain institutional change.

Global public policies designed to mitigate climate instability and assist society in adapting are embedded within a multifaceted transnational architecture. Key components of this architecture include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. A notable paradox in global climate policies is that, while climate change is a global risk, its impacts are felt locally. This creates political tension between local governments and national or international authorities, particularly within the United Nations system. Cities contend that although national and international bodies formulate and deliberate on global climate policies, local authorities are on the front lines, dealing with the consequences of extreme climate events. In response, local governments have been active on multiple fronts: advocating for greater involvement in global climate discussions and sharing best practices on urban climate policies among cities. This presentation examines the role of the Brazilian government and its cities in the realm of transnational urban climate policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osmany Porto de Oliveira&lt;/strong&gt; is Tenured Assistant Professor in the International Relations Department at the Federal University of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo (Unifesp) and coordinator of the International Public Policies Laboratory (Laboppi). He holds a PhD in Political Science, from the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle &amp;ndash; Paris III (2015) and a PhD from the University of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo (2013). His research centers on policy transfer, development cooperation, international organizations, democracy and climate change. He received different international awards, such as the Early Career Award of the International Public Policy Association &amp;ndash; IPPA (2019) and the Annual Best Comparative Article Award from the Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis (2023).&amp;nbsp;His main books are: Brazil and China in Knowledge and Policy Transfer (Palgrave, 2022), with G. Romano; Handbook of Policy Transfer, Diffusion and Circulation (Edward Elgar, 2021); Latin America and Policy Diffusion (Routledge, 2020),&amp;nbsp;with C. Osorio, S. Montero and C. Leite;&amp;nbsp;International Policy Diffusion and Participatory Budgeting&amp;nbsp;(Palgrave,&amp;nbsp;2017).

Previously unexamined, these letters movingly demonstrate the power of the personal, as the pen pals engaged in a &amp;ldquo;diplomacy of the heart&amp;rdquo; that led them to question why their countries were so divided. The correspondence also inspired them individually to reexamine their own societies and lives through a critical lens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexis Peri&lt;/strong&gt; is an Associate Professor of History at Boston University. She has published The War Within: Diaries from the Siege of Leningrad (Harvard University Press, 2017), named in the Wall Street Journal as one of the ten best books on the Soviet home front. Her new book is Dear Unknown Friend: The Remarkable Correspondence between American and Soviet Women (Harvard University Press, 2024).

Our theoretical framework is based on the deep image prior hypothesis that posits the existence of a convolutional neural network with iid noise as input, capable of generating natural images with properly tuned parameters. Our theoretical results reveal that acquiring high-quality images in such systems requires more measurements compared to those with additive noises. Furthermore, they reveal the advantages and bottlenecks of multilooking, a mechanism of capturing multiple images of the same scene. On the applied side, we introduce the &amp;quot;Bagged-DIP&amp;quot; approach, leveraging the DIP-hypothesis to enhance the performance of standard DIPs in image recovery from speckle-corrupted measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Arian&amp;nbsp;Maleki&amp;nbsp;is an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp; Arian&amp;rsquo;s research interests compressed sensing, computational imaging, machine learning, and&amp;nbsp;high-dimensional statistics.&amp;nbsp;Prior to his work at Columbia, Arian was a postdoctoral scholar at Rice University. He received his PhD from Stanford University, completing a dissertation on the &amp;ldquo;approximate message passing for compressed sensing&amp;rdquo;. His&amp;nbsp;BSc degree in Electrical Engineering&amp;nbsp;was completed at Sharif University in Tehran, Iran.&lt;/p&gt;",

Their bottom line is not financial profit but the common good. Drawing on his extensive career, John Marks has written a practitioner&amp;rsquo;s guide to the underlying principles of social entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;From Vision to Action&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers a master class in effective negotiation and conflict resolution. It builds on a core strategy of understanding differences and acting on commonalities.

When he stepped down as its president after thirty-two years, the organization had a staff of six hundred full-time employees and offices in thirty-five countries. He is now the founder and managing director of Confluence International and a visiting scholar in peacebuilding and social entrepreneurship at Leiden University.

This lecture explores the pivotal role of clinical research professionals (CRPs), such as coordinators and research assistants, in the eligibility prescreening process. By analyzing data from a free-listing survey of 150 CRPs across diverse fields like neurological disorders and rare diseases, the session will provide key insights into the information CRPs prioritize. We will discuss how domain-specific variations impact prescreening approaches and discover strategies for refining CRP training and prescreening tools to optimize recruitment while maintaining ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, October 2nd from 10:00 &amp;ndash; 11:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please register below&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 TRIAL INNOVATION NETWORK (TIN) 2024 SNAPSHOT LECTURE SERIES&lt;br /&gt;\nPresented by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/about-us/resources-and-cores/network-capacity\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TIN&amp;nbsp;Resource&amp;nbsp;of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Join the CTL for a workshop for graduate students focused on giving you tools to assess students accurately, efficiently, and encouragingly. In this workshop, you will learn approaches for assessing student learning and providing feedback that encourages students to focus more on their improvement and less on bottom line scores. We will introduce tools to help streamline and standardize assessment and feedback, while helping students better understand what is valuable in the topic and discipline. Breakout groups during this session will allow you to focus your discussion on written assignments or problem sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to this session, participants are expected to have completed a 20-minute module on Canvas. To get started on the module, self-enroll in the Essentials Canvas site here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/enroll/CBT7BT\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/enroll/CBT7BT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of this session, participants should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Describe the difference between formative and summative assessments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop the values and concepts that underlay meaningful, relevant, and accessible feedback.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan activities you can use with your students to measure students&amp;#39; learning and get feedback on your teaching.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;***Registration will close the night before this&amp;nbsp;session.***&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Essentials of Teaching and Learning workshop series for graduate students is focused on giving you tools as a new or developing instructor to better facilitate student learning and improve your teaching practice. These workshops are best experienced sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the last&amp;nbsp;of 4 sessions being held at the same time on the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating an Inclusive Course Climate, 9/11&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Backward Design and Learning Objectives, 9/18&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Active Learning, 9/25&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assessment and Feedback for Learning, 10/2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information and registration links for these additional sessions, visit&lt;a href=\"https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/workshops-for-graduate-students/essentials/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the CTL website&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Attending this workshop and posting reflections satisfies a Foundational Track requirement for participants in the Teaching Development Program (TDP).

Yet these advances have been subverted by ill-advised uses and by bad actors creating hate speech, disinformation, job loss and industry disruption, monopolistic abuse of market dominance, helplessness, mental distress, injustice, loss of privacy, and poor security and safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These nightmares seem overwhelming, but there is much that we can do, much that we must do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As digital technology professionals, we can focus on computer science applications in the service of good. We can anticipate how our creations may be subverted by poor design or bad actors and adjust our plans accordingly. Throughout our careers, we can be guided by our conscience and by ethics. Looking outwards, we can educate people to better understand digital technologies and their uses and misuses. We can aid citizens seeking to avoid adverse consequences of tech deployment. As professionals, we can seek systems and standards of effective education and accountability. Finally, we can work with governments to ensure appropriate legislation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will pay particular attention to artificial intelligence, a technology of great potential for human betterment that may be negated by harms that arise when it is deployed before it is reliable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bio Sketch&lt;br /&gt;\nAn internationally recognized innovator, author, speaker, teacher, and mentor, Ron is Emeritus Professor of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where he co-founded the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) and founded the Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI) and the Technologies for Aging Gracefully lab (TAGlab). Every fall, he now teaches Computers and Society at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He has been named one of the 60 Pioneers of Computer Graphics by ACM SIGGRAPH, has been elected to the CHI (Computers and Human Interaction) Academy by ACM SIGCHI, has been named an ACM Fellow, and has been given a Canadian Digital Media Pioneer Award.

Moderated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Aleksandar Bo&amp;scaron;kovi\u0107&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The First World War interrupted or redirected the creative work of many artists. They created art on the front, behind the front, in prisoner of war campus, in occupied territories, and in exile. In contrast to the Austrian literature of this period, Serbian literature produced during World War I must be divided into two text corpora, each exhibiting different motifs and linguistic expressions: literature written by authors from the Kingdom of Serbia (Stanislav Vinaver, Rastko Petrovi\u0107, Stevan Jakovljevi\u0107, Stanislav Krakov, Vladislav Petkovi\u0107-Dis, Branislav Nu&amp;scaron;i\u0107, etc.), and literature by the Serbs of the Habsburg Monarchy. This literature ranges from war chronicles by soldier-writers to avant-garde memoirs and poems that sought to make sense of the war. Newspapers also included literary appendices that testified to the vitality of Serbian culture in exile because the press in Serbia was subjected to strict censorship by the occupying forces. Much of the war literature was repressed and rejected after 1919, and, since then, scholars have mainly looked to the Habsburg Serbian authors, such as Milo&amp;scaron; Crnjanski, to represent the Serbian war experience. In this lecture, Gordana Ili\u0107 Markovi\u0107 will also discuss the topic of WWI in the world of Miroslav Krle\u017ea and Ivo Anrdi\u0107, as well as in the diaries and memoirs of South Slavs and Austrian soldiers and civilians. All of these authors were active participants in the war, believing in the possibility of change through personal and collective intervention. Some distanced themselves from their pre-war artistic expression, becoming passive observers of chroniclers of war.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Adamant is a one-of-a-kind place: a floating refuge on the Seine River in the heart of Paris that offers day programs for adults with mental illnesses. Its attendees come from across the city and are offered care that grounds them in time and space, helping them achieve recovery and stability. Through a blend of therapy, education, and culture rooted in music and the arts, the Adamant offers a hopeful vision of what a humanistic approach to mental health care can look like. The community on the boat is intentionally created so that both the staff and the people receiving care are treated with the same respect and dignity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/b43bHQb0UFE?si=GrXIA0UMLkUuWGEu\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lena Green&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is Lecturer in Social Work at Columbia University and currently serves as the executive director of the HOPE Center, a community-based mental health clinic connected to Harlem&amp;rsquo;s historic First Corinthian Baptist Church.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanny Peer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the Director of the Columbia Maison Fran&amp;ccedil;aise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This screening is part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://maisonfrancaise.columbia.edu/events/cinemacare-maison-francaise-film-festival-fall-2024\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CINEMA/CARE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://maisonfrancaise.columbia.edu/events/cinemacare-maison-francaise-film-festival-fall-2024\"&gt;Maison Francaise Film Festival Fall 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;More info&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://maisonfrancaise.columbia.edu/events/cinemacare-maison-francaise-film-festival-fall-2024\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Over her career as a dyer and weaver in Ahuir&amp;aacute;n, Mexico, she has mastered many kinds of knowledge: environmental, cultural, chemical, historical, and tacit. Over a nine-day residency at Columbia University, Bertha and her son Mateo shared their embodied knowledge with undergraduate and graduate students across disciplines in the Making and Knowing Project&amp;rsquo;s laboratory seminar class. The seminar investigates embodied knowledge, historical techniques, and the intersections between artistic making and scientific knowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Students have the opportunity to work alongside Bertha and Mateo, learning about the materials for creating natural colors (including marigold flowers, coconut husks, and pomegranate peels), techniques, and the many forms of knowledge embedded in dyeing. During this showcase, Bertha and Mateo will give an introduction to their work and the Pur&amp;eacute;pecha dyeing tradition and students will share their textile results and insights from their hands-on experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bertha Estrada, dyer and weaver&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mateo Rodriguez Estrada, dyer and weaver&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-and-knowing-dyeing-showcase-with-bertha-estrada-registration-1012879478787\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Despite great promise, we have yet to harness the high-resolution information on cell states and fates that single-cell genomics data offer to understand cell fate decisions. Nor do we know in most cases how these decisions are controlled by gene regulatory networks. I will describe our recent work in constructing models of cell fate networks via the multiscale coupling of networks at two levels: cell-cell communication and of gene regulatory states. Through analysis of combination therapies for metastatic breast cancer, we have discovered new mechanisms by which modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment can improve patient outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam MacLean develops theory to understand cell fate decision-making in stem cells and cancer. He has developed models of cell-cell communication, and the gene regulatory networks that control cell fate decisions via single-cell multi-omics data analysis and statistical inference. He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, at the University of Southern California. He studied mathematical physics (BSc) at the University of Edinburgh, and completed a PhD in systems biology from Imperial College London. He worked as a postdoc at the University of Oxford and the University of California Irvine, before joining USC in 2019. Recent awards for his work include an NSF CAREER award (2022) and an NIH R35 MIRA award (2022).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/242136046951151\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Contract Gaming and Revenue Allocation in Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-authors: Atul Gupta (University of Pennsylvania) and Ambar La Forgia (UC Berkeley)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Firms often exploit loopholes in government contracts to boost revenues. The welfare consequences of this behavior depend on how firms use the marginal windfall dollar, yet little evidence exists to guide policymakers. This paper studies how hospitals allocated over $3 billion obtained from gaming a Medicare payment loophole. The average gaming hospital increased both Medicare and total revenue by around 10%, implying large spillovers on other payers. Consistent with theories of organizational behavior, nonprofit hospitals deployed most of the windfall toward operating costs, while for-profits deducted the entire amount off their balance sheet, distributing a substantial portion to executives and shareholders. Accordingly, we detect modest reductions in mortality rates at nonprofits but no changes at for-profits. Our results imply that the consequences of such engineered windfalls vary substantially by hospital ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Sacarny&amp;#39;s research explores the relationship between health care payment policy, provider and patient decision-making, and clinical quality. Much of this work involves using randomized controlled trials to test interventions in the health care delivery system. His research on health care providers has studied the effects of behavioral interventions on overprescribing, the adoption of hospital documentation and coding practices, and the relationship between hospital clinical outcomes and market share.&lt;/p&gt;",

In his new book &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/book\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free and Equal: A Manifesto for a Just Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, economist and philosopher Daniel Chandler looks to the ideas of political philosopher John Rawls to reinvigorate liberalism and develop a new model of capitalism that would genuinely work for all. But is Rawls the thinker we need right now? What would a truly just economy look like? And how could we bring it about?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our panel will include &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Chandler&lt;/a&gt; (London School of Economics), &lt;a href=\"https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/daniel-luban\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Luban&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) and &lt;a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/alex-raskolnikov\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alex Raskolnikov&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia). &lt;a href=\"https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/communities-connections/faculty/suresh-naidu\"&gt;Suresh Naidu&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) will chair and moderate the discussion.&amp;nbsp;This program is brought to you in partnership with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/socialenterprise\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tamer Institute for Social Enterprise and Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This panel will take place on the third floor of the Forum in Room 315.

This is a new opportunity and space is limited. &lt;strong&gt;A registration link will be shared with all participants in the Essentials series this term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this Practice Teaching session, CTL will pair you with a trained peer facilitator and a group of about 3 other graduate students in the Essentials series. Together, you and your fellow participants will take turns delivering short (&amp;lt;7 min.) samples of instruction to each other and practice putting into action the concepts and strategies discussed in the Essentials series. After each teaching sample, your facilitator and your peers will offer structured feedback to support your teaching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new offering is an opportunity&amp;nbsp;to try out the application of an approach or technique learned during the Essentials series. Participation in this Practice Teaching session is also a great way to make some quick headway on the CTL&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://tdp.ctl.columbia.edu/\"&gt;Teaching Development Program (TDP)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as this session satisfies the Application and Practice requirement of the Foundational Track.

Contrary to this common view, emotion and affect are integral to the development of comparative law, particularly through the lens of the US-China relationship, which can be characterized as &amp;quot;adversarial comparativism.&amp;quot; Rather than using law to emulate or learn from one another, the US and China engage in legal strategies aimed at outmaneuvering each other. This dynamic is evident in China&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of US-style extraterritoriality and the development of China-related property regimes by US state governments. These examples of adversarial comparativism illustrate how emotion drives legal frameworks in the context of a US-China rivalry, offering insight into the increasingly fragmented landscape of international law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is organized by the &lt;a href=\"https://chinese-legal-studies.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hong Yen Chang Center for Chinese Legal Studies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and co-sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"https://parker-school.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Parker School of Foreign &amp;amp; Comparative Law &lt;/a&gt;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.jtl.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Columbia Journal of Transnational Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew S.

    "description": "&lt;h3&gt;The Human Rights Lens: An ISHR Student-Faculty Conversation Series&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please join Professor Joseph Slaughter, ISHR Executive Director with Josephine Koch, UHRP &amp;#39;25, to discuss &amp;quot;Hijacking Human Rights: Neoliberalism, the New Historiography, and the End of the Third World.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recent histories of human rights identify the 1970s as a &amp;quot;breakthrough&amp;quot; period when they gained traction globally. However, most of the new historiographers adopt a restricted Americo-Eurocentric Perspective that disregards events and peoples in the rest of the world as makers of human rights history. For many in the Global South, the Western &amp;quot;rediscovery&amp;quot; of human rights in the 1970s looks more like retrenchment and repossession, part of a larger &amp;quot;rollback&amp;quot; on Third World agendas to decolonize and reshape the international order. This same period also saw an increased use of airline hijackings as a tactic of national liberation movements, which helped to speed a reversal in the official discourse on &amp;quot;terrorism.&amp;quot; Together, these forces facilitated a neoliberal hijacking of human rights that delegitimized national self-determination, narrowed international concern to the plight of individual political prisoners, and realigned the moral economy of human rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This series offers student-led conversations on human rights and social justice issues, examined through the work of ISHR faculty. Participants are asked to read the research in advance.&amp;nbsp;Light lunch will be served.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Registration is required for this event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Philosophy Hall Room 302&lt;/p&gt;",

The monthly seminars take place on the second Wednesday of the month, 2:00-3:00 PM EST. The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, October 9th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Carlos Carmona-Fontaine, Associate Professor of Biology, New York University. Seminar hosted by Simon Tavar&amp;eacute;. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus).

While competition in cancer is widely studied, the role of cell cooperation and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their size falls below a critical tipping point. I will present our recent work where we sought to identify cooperative mechanisms in cancer so that we can exploit them and drive tumor populations to this critical point. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyzes these peptides, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperation to scavenge nutrients is key to survive in the tumor microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability. I will also present additional mathematical and experimental models showing how we can use insights from ecology to better understand the tumor&lt;br /&gt;\nmicroenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Carlos Carmona-Fontaine is an Associate Professor of Biology and member of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. He holds a Ph.D. in Cell and Developmental Biology from University College London, UK and a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from Chile. The main interest of his laboratory is to understand how cells organize to form multicellular structures and to coordinate in collective processes. Multicellular is important during physiological processes such as embryonic development but it is also critical in cancer and other diseases. The work of his lab suggests that a large part of this organization emerges from social and ecological interactions between cells that are mediated by metabolites &amp;ndash; nutrients and waste products of cellular activity. Prior to joining the faculty at NYU, Carlos was an independent research fellow at the Computational Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He received a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award during his postdoctoral research and was awarded the Beddington Medal for his doctoral studies. As faculty member he received a number of grants including a DP2 New Innovator Award from the NIH, a Pew Biomedical Fellowship, and an American Cancer Society research fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

Participants discuss factors that impact their choices around alcohol usage and how to navigate difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Session open to all Columbia University students, regardless of school affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that Alice!

In the United States, one in three babies is born via C-section, a rate that has grown exponentially over the past fifty years. While in most cases the procedure is safe, it is not without significant, sometimes life-changing consequences, many of which affect people of color disproportionately. Invisible Labor lifts the veil on C-sections so that people can make choices about pregnancy and surgical birth with greater knowledge of the risks, benefits, and alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rachel Somerstein will be in conversation with Dr. Christopher Travis, MD, MS, an alumnx of the Columbia Narrative Medicine masters program and Assistant Professor and Assistant Education Director for Narrative Medicine in the Department of OB/GYN at University Hospitals/Case Western Reserve University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Born into precarious freedom after the American Revolution and reaching adulthood in the lead-up to the Civil War, this remarkable generation ultimately played an outsized role in political and legal conflicts over slavery&amp;rsquo;s future, influencing both the nation&amp;rsquo;s path to the Civil War and changes to the US Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The Rising Generation&lt;/em&gt; shows how, as the children of gradual abolition reached adulthood, they took the lessons of their youth into midcentury campaigns for legal equality, political inclusion, equitable common school education, and the expansion of freedom across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;",

The risks of fiscal crisis and/or hyperinflation are increasing. Unfair burdens will be placed on younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3) Japan is struggling to proceed with decarbonization, lagging in transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and EV).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The annual lecture details these challenges and presents recommendations for remedies and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takatoshi Ito&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, has taught extensively both in the United States and Japan since finishing his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University in 1979. He taught at the University of Minnesota, Hitotsubashi University, and the University of Tokyo, and he was President of the Japanese Economic Association in 2004. Ito served as Senior Advisor in the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund, 1994-97, Deputy Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance of Japan, 1999-2001, and a member of the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, 2006-08. He is an author of Japanese Economy, 2nd Edition, and many other books and refereed journal articles.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The final years of the Third Reich witnessed the rise of a radical strain of chronopolitical discourse suggesting that a German defeat would spell the very end of history. History had only come into being under Hitler and it would perish with him. Ultimately, the war was a gigantic fireworks display in which a fatally accelerated &amp;quot;time without precedent&amp;quot; (Goebbels) was using up all its historical energy. This radical strain was there from the beginning of Nazism and survived its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The talk will analyze its peculiar logic by tracing and connecting several manifestations: the notion of terminal performance underlying the widespread abuse of the methamphetamine Pervitin; the idea of compressed morbidity guiding the future plans of Nazi insurance agencies to advocate a policy of senicide; the early literary prefiguration of the monopolization of history by the Third Reich in Katharine Burdekin&amp;#39;s 1937 dystopia Swastika Night; Hans Blumenberg&amp;#39;s philosophical take on Hitler&amp;#39;s final days; and, most importantly, the post-Stalingrad rhetoric of Joseph Goebbels, who in the wake of Hitler&amp;#39;s increasing absence becomes the principal purveyor of the Nazi chronobscene.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geoffrey Winthrop-Young&lt;/strong&gt; (MA Freiburg, PhD UBC) is Professor of German and Nordic Studies at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* Reception to follow&lt;/p&gt;",

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This year, despite vociferous internal protest, the Subcommission on Quarternary Stratigraphy denied the existence of an Anthropocene epoch as a formal unit of the Geological Time Scale, opting for the looser geological concept of an &amp;ldquo;episode&amp;rdquo;. What began with a bang ended with a whimper&amp;mdash;this was an inauspicious end to a period where so much ink has been spent on a geological concept in the social sciences and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or was it not an ending at all? While geology has formalized timekeeping procedures, the life of a concept in critical scholarship tends to be irresolute, more valued for the questions it raises than the matters it puts to rest. In the name of the Anthropocene, renewed attention to capitalism&amp;rsquo;s terraforming force emerged. New approaches to the multiple temporalities of history and more-than-human assemblages have been devised; new anthropogenic ecologies have been imagined; the boundaries between life and nonlife have become critical problematics. The traffic between earth science and social and humanities scholarship went in several directions. In selecting a &amp;ldquo;golden spike&amp;rdquo; for the Anthropocene, geologists trying to extract a sediment core from a Canadian lake were embroiled in controversies over Indigenous cosmologies and land stewardship, settler colonization, and nuclear fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles, this panel conducts a post-mortem inquiry for the Anthropocene. Does the geological rejection of the term matter for how humanists should think about relations between the social and the planetary? What did the Anthropocene debacle reveal about epistemic power relations? And where to go now?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/leah-aronowsky\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leah Aronowsky&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Climate at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/elizabeth-povinelli\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elizabeth Povinelli&lt;/a&gt;, Franz Boas Professor of Anthropology and Gender Studies at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/shr7208.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sophia Roosth&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at New York University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-post-mortem-for-the-anthropocene-registration-976730425997\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Others have noted that pre-modern empires did not observe a secular separation of church and state; instead, one invariably finds a complex entanglement of religious and state institutions. This talk seeks to explore the intersection of these two claims in the borderlands of the Russian empire and the Qing empire, as well as those of their respective successors. Through a series of cases from the early modern to contemporary, it seeks to show how representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church selectively adopted political strategies and semiotic forms from other Christian and non-Christian religious traditions through processes of inter-imperial contact and competition. In the course of discussing these cases, the talk will also seek to highlight the role of ostensibly secular state officials in catalyzing these moments of cultural transfer.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;On October 18, 2024, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University will convene scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and activists for a symposium about surveillance and censorship and the changing role of the international border.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. government uses its authority over the border to justify the surveillance of social media, the interrogation of travelers about their political and religious views, the warrantless search of travelers&amp;rsquo; laptops and cellphones, the imposition of limits on Americans&amp;rsquo; right to engage with foreign speakers and to access foreign communications platforms, and the suspension of the constitutional rules that would ordinarily apply to the surveillance of Americans&amp;rsquo; emails and telephone calls. Panelists will consider these practices and their implications from a range of perspectives, including theoretical, doctrinal, historical, and empirical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Regardless of Frontiers&amp;rdquo; will also feature a photo exhibition entitled &amp;ldquo;Infrastructures of Control,&amp;rdquo; by&amp;nbsp;Colter Thomas&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Dugan Meyer. Through a series of photographs, the exhibit aims to create a visual archive of security and surveillance infrastructure in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. An opening reception will be held on the evening of October 17 at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will take place at Columbia University and online.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The economic activities of a company can exacerbate the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land and sea use change, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. Direct drivers have impacts on species and ecosystems while affecting people who rely on ecosystem services for their livelihood. In addition, the majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest companies have a significant dependency on nature across their direct operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conversations about biodiversity have focused on ecological conservation efforts, habitat restoration, and on-the-ground fieldwork in specific locations. In recent years, biodiversity reporting frameworks that attempt to capture the total financial impact and dependency of individual corporations have begun to emerge. Frameworks such as TNFD, GRI 101, and ESRS E4 will shape corporate disclosure on how issuers impact and rely on biodiversity, illuminating the financial risks related to this dependence, and highlighting steps companies can and should take to mitigate their impact on biodiversity loss. Dr. Satyajit Bose, Associate Director of the Climate School&amp;rsquo;s Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management and Professor of Professional Practice at SPS, will interview a panel of ecology, biodiversity, financial, and corporate disclosure experts about the challenges and potential for corporate management of natural capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome Remarks: Dr. Steven Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; is the Director of the Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management at Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Climate School.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a fascinating presentation of Dr. Robert Klitzman&amp;#39;s new book, &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Will-You-Pray-Chaplains/dp/0197750842\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Will You Pray For Me? Medicine, Chaplains, and Healing the Whole Person&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The modern world faces religious, spiritual and existential quandaries, as new technologies redefine the beginnings and ends of life. Excruciating choices arise about when to turn off the machines&amp;mdash;whether and when we should &amp;quot;play God.&amp;quot; The COVID-19 pandemic made these dilemmas ever more acute. Increasingly, however, public discourse on religion and spirituality is polarized, with evangelicals on one side and vehement atheists on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book explores how patients and families struggle to make sense of serious disease and threats of death and other medical crises, seeking hope, purpose and larger connections beyond themselves. Physicians and other clinical staff are frequently uncomfortable with these issues, and chaplains have been filling the void, developing valuable approaches and insights. Most Americans will live out their final years in hospitals or nursing homes, and face existential and spiritual quandaries. Many of their prior religious and spiritual beliefs will fall short, and chaplains will often be the ones to assist, partly by reframing narratives and understandings of illness and spirituality. Yet people often know little, if anything, about these professionals. Klitzman presents stories about the spiritual lives of patients and explores the role of chaplains&amp;mdash;who they are, what they do and the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drawing on in-depth interviews and the author&amp;#39;s personal experiences, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor, Will You Pray for Me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides vital information that can assist in medical care decisions. Dr. Klitzman argues that a better understanding of the relationship between these realms will enable more holistic and humane treatment of patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1001512941167?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Klitzman, M.D., Program Director, Bioethics; Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Athina Fontenot (af3018@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC.

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/242136046951151\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

What they rarely consider is that, like that of any other nation, America&amp;rsquo;s DNA differs from that of their country. It may take a lifetime to adjust to the unfamiliar country&amp;rsquo;s culture, mentality, and way of doing many things differently from the way they have known. It is especially true when immigrants come to America from a country based on different principles, in this case, collectivist Russia versus individualist America, with opposing political systems&amp;mdash;the democratic American one and the totalitarian Soviet. A sequel to the author&amp;rsquo;s autobiographical trilogy&amp;mdash;Shush! Growing up Jewish under Stalin, In the Jaws of the Crocodile, and Farewell, Mama Odessa&amp;mdash;this book is part mem&amp;shy;oir and part cultural study about the challenges of immigration and American acculturation. With self-deprecating humor, the author, a former Soviet satirist who was punished for trespassing the boundaries of public criticism, recollects his growing pains as he overcame his indoctrinated upbringing in a totalitarian society to embrace America&amp;rsquo;s defining values.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this talk, I explore the&amp;nbsp;drivers of the retirement boom and its unexpected persistence. In the first part, I present findings covering the initial year of the pandemic. Using large-scale public survey data to explore patterns in employment and retirement transitions among older adults, I find that retirement transitions increased broadly across demographic groups but concentrated at the high and low ends of the earnings distribution. Job characteristics that best predicted increased pandemic retirement transitions were employment in high-contact occupations and part-time work schedules. In the second part of the talk, I zoom out to explore the persistence of the pandemic retirement boom in the years since 2020. Using approaches from machine learning to project counterfactual retirement trends, I provide current estimates for the number of excess retirees in the U.S. population and the demographic breakdown of this group. Finally, I discuss the implications for retirement policy, older adults&amp;#39; welfare, and economic theories about retirement behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Traditionally, they have been analyzed using compartmental models (Bass, SI, ...), which implicitly assume that all the individuals are homogeneous and connected to each other. To relax these assumptions, research has gradually shifted to the more fundamental network models, which are particle models for the stochastic adoption/infection by each individual. In this talk I will present an emerging mathematical theory for the Bass and SI models on networks. I will present analytic tools that enable us to obtain explicit expressions for the&amp;nbsp; expected adoption/infection level on various networks (complete, circular, d-regular, Erdos- Renyi, ...), without employing mean-field type approximations. The main focus of the talk will be&amp;nbsp; on the effect of network structure. For example, which networks yield the slowest and fastest spreading? What is the effect of boundaries? Of heterogeneity among individuals? How does the network structure influence the optimal promotional strategy?&lt;/p&gt;",

This collection brings together forty stories&amp;mdash;at times excruciatingly difficult yet deeply moving&amp;mdash;about women confronted by the countless brutalities of war. It locates the voices and devastating experiences of those who have been silenced, those who have lost loved ones, those who have fought and persevered, and those who have broken down. Yuliia will be joined by her American publisher, Andrew Felsher, who will share insights into the challenges, significance, and joy of bringing international voices to English-speaking audiences.&amp;nbsp;Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/mark-andryczyk/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Andryczyk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Departing from leading theoretical accounts which present the courts and legislature as rivals for constitutional supremacy, Kavanagh argues that protecting rights is a collaborative enterprise between all three branches of government - the Executive, the legislature, and the courts. On a collaborative vision of constitutionalism, protecting rights is neither the solitary task of a Herculean super-judge, nor the dignified pronouncements of an enlightened legislature. Instead, it is a complex, dynamic, and collaborative endeavour, where each branch has a distinct but complementary role to play, whilst engaging with each other in a spirit of comity and mutual respect. Connecting constitutional theory with the practice of protecting rights in a democracy, this book offers an innovative understanding of the separation of powers, grounded in the values and virtues of constitutional collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;",

This two-part LC will consider these questions and the effect of interdisciplinary teaching more broadly. Among the goals of this LC is to consider the benefits of constructing a unified academy and what effect interdisciplinarity has on our students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Graduate student instructors at Columbia encounter students of every major and academic background, particularly in courses taught as part of the core curriculum and language instruction. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching is a valuable method by which to engage students across academic interests. It also supports students&amp;rsquo; learning across disciplines, highlights&amp;nbsp;how knowledge interconnects between academic departments, and encourages students to pursue their own interdisciplinary approach to learning. This LC is intended for participants from all academic disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and will be co-facilitated by Marissa Swan and Emma Leidy, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Wednesday 10/30, 2:10pm&amp;ndash;3:25pm, is available &lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb7c-91bc1926-0191-bdd6412d-00003ca7events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Within a few short years, she became famous: she was read and debated from Russia to Prussia, from Switzerland to England, from up north in Sweden to down south in Italy. This was not just remarkable because she was a woman, but because of the substance of her contributions. While the men in her milieu like Voltaire and Kant sought disciples to promote their ideas, Du Ch&amp;acirc;telet promoted intellectual autonomy. She counselled her readers to read the classics, but never to become a follower of another&amp;#39;s ideas. Her proclamation that a true philosopher must remain an independent thinker, rather than a disciple of some supposedly &amp;ldquo;great man&amp;rdquo; like Isaac Newton or Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes, posed a threat to an emerging consensus in the Enlightenment. And that made her dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rew Janiak&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor of Philosophy and co-leader of Project Vox at Duke University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christia Mercer&lt;/strong&gt; is Gustave M.

Yet, we have the poorest health outcomes. Racial disparities in health, from birth to the end of life, have remained stubbornly in place for decades or longer, even among educated, wealthy Black Americans. My talk will discuss these issues, and lean into solutions informed by my perspective as a journalist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Presentation followed by a moderated discussion then Audience Q&amp;amp;A with Yvonne Ortiz, MEd.

In an era of conflict, crisis, disinformation and fragmentation, public health is more challenging - and more urgent - than ever. 2024-25&amp;rsquo;s Grand Rounds will look at the role of public health in current affairs, and the way current affairs are impacting public health. Together we&amp;rsquo;ll engage in discussions about today&amp;rsquo;s greatest public health challenges, how to learn across differences, potential compromises and solutions, and apply an interdisciplinary lens to understand how some of the biggest debates of the moment are shaping the sector. From themes like the political determinants of health, understanding the toll of inequality on the health of people, and the health consequences of war and crisis, Grand Rounds will focus on threats to public health today as well as what we need to address them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nGrand Rounds was initiated in 2008 at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health to create an intellectual space within which to explore national and global public health challenges and the innovative approaches needed to transform the public&amp;rsquo;s health in the 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We value inclusion and access for all participants and are pleased to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

They are eager to learn local languages. Immigration is not a burden on social services. Border walls do not work. There is no unmanageable refugee crisis. Yet many such misinformed assumptions and harmful misconceptions pervade conversations about immigration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a timely, practical, and evidence-based discussion on immigrants and immigration. Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione debunk frequently encountered claims and answer common questions. Invoking the latest findings and decades of interdisciplinary research and considering a wide range of places, ethnic groups, and historical eras, Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione provide the key data and context to understand how immigration affects economies, crime rates, and social welfare systems, and shed light on contentious issues such as the safety of the U.S.-Mexico border and the consequences of Brexit. This conversation aims to be a guide for those who want to counter false claims about immigration and are interested in what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time will be allocated for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione have produced a powerfully-written and persuasive statement against several of the most common stereotypes about contemporary immigration. It is a particularly timely book given the wave of nativism and anti-immigrant rhetoric now sweeping the political scene of America and other developed nations.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Alejandro Portes&lt;/strong&gt;, Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing at the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ernesto Casta&amp;ntilde;eda&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;the Founding Director of the Immigration Lab, and Director of the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies and&amp;nbsp;Full Professor&amp;nbsp;at American University in Washington, DC.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The inaugural CtCe Conference is part of a larger initiative to generate practical and rigorous research on frontier blockchain topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CBER Crafting the Cryptoeconomy (CtCe) Conference is an event to educate attendees on the most recent developments in the cryptoeconomy.&amp;nbsp;Topics covered will include Maximal Extractable Value, Restaking, Layer 2s, Order Flow Auction Design, Uniswap v4 and DeFi Regulation. Speakers will include Alexander Nezlobin (London School of Economics), Alfred Lehar (University of Calgary), Andrea Canidio (CoW Protocol), Andreas Park (University of Toronto), Benedikt B&amp;uuml;nz (NYU Courant), Brad Bachu (Uniswap Labs), Brett Falk (University of Pennsylvania), Brian Nistler (Uniswap Foundation), Bruno Biais (HEC Paris), Campbell Harvey (Duke University), Ciamac Moallemi (Columbia University), Ed Felten (Princeton University), Fabian Sch&amp;auml;r (University of Basel), Fahad Saleh (University of Florida), Jiasun Li (George Mason University), Joel Hasbrouck (NYU Stern), Julian Ma (Ethereum Foundation), Katya Malinova (McMaster University), Mallesh Pai (Rice University), Michael Junho Lee (Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and Tim Roughgarden (Columbia University).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CBER CtCe Conference is part of a larger initiative to generate practical and rigorous research on frontier blockchain topics. In more detail, in parallel with the CBER CtCe conference, CBER Forum is releasing a Call for Research Proposals where winning grants will receive funding of up to $50,000 financed generously by the Uniswap Foundation. The content of the CtCe conference will be aimed at providing context on frontier blockchain research topics (see above) so as to provide the background necessary for potential applicants to form competitive research proposal applications. This context will be provided both through &amp;quot;Workshop Sessions&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Research Sessions&amp;quot; where Workshop sessions will explain novel blockchain topics worthy of study whereas Research sessions will entail presentations of contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CBER CtCe Conference will be hosted by&amp;nbsp;Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Digital Finance and Technologies on October 25 - 26 in New York City. The conference is sponsored by Avalanche Foundation and Uniswap Foundation. Moreover, the conference is a collaboration across Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Digital Finance and Technologies, Boston University&amp;rsquo;s Digital Business Institute at the Questrom School of Business, Ecole Polytechnique, FinTech at Cornell - an Initiative of the SC Johnson College of Business, the FinTech Research Center at the University of Florida, the NYU Stern School of Business, and the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management&amp;rsquo;s FinHub.&amp;nbsp;For the latest details regarding the conference, please consult the conference website at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://ctce.cber-forum.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://ctce.cber-forum.org/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or contact CBER Forum at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:contact@cber-forum.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;contact@cber-forum.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

In forty-eight short chapters, &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the dynamics of intercultural encounters through the medium of material texts. Each essay focuses on one object to demonstrate how particular ways of reading can render the complex meanings of the objects legible\u2015or explains why and how the meanings remain illegible. In its diversity and breadth, this volume shows how the field of book history can be more inclusive and expansive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium features scholars from multiple disciplines and career stages. Together, across three panels, they will address questions about the role of collaboration in research, the pedagogical uses of &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt;, and the future of book history. Participants include Ahmed Alami, Rhae Lynn Barnes, Glenda Goodman, David Hall, Joseph Howley, Abimbola Cole Kai-Lewis, Isadora Mota, Shari Rabin, Martin Tsang, and Adrian Weimer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will be followed by a reception beginning at 4pm in the Rare Book &amp;amp; Manuscript Library on the 6th floor.&lt;/p&gt;",

Picking up on this theme, this seminar explores the role&lt;br /&gt;\nof central banks in governing finance not only in the midst of financial crises, but also&lt;br /&gt;\ncontinuously as guardians of financial stability. Remarkably, the shadow banking system, which&lt;br /&gt;\nhad largely been viewed as causal for the 2008 crisis, expanded rather than contracting under the&lt;br /&gt;\nwatch of central banks. When faced with new episodes of financial instability, central banks have&lt;br /&gt;\nresponded with more large-scale asset purchases and similar measures to support the financial&lt;br /&gt;\nsystem. This raises the question whether central banks are governing finance, or whether,&lt;br /&gt;\ninstead, finance is forcing central banks to dance to their tune. This is not a new question, and&lt;br /&gt;\nneither is it limited to the US, or even the circle of the C5 (Fed, Bank of England, ECB, Swiss&lt;br /&gt;\nCB, Bank of Japan). By putting the recent episodes of the entanglement of central banks with&lt;br /&gt;\nfinance into historical perspective, we are hoping to shed new light on the forces that shape&lt;br /&gt;\nmoney, banking, and finance more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lev Menand&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia Law School&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stefano Ugolini&lt;br /&gt;\nUniversity of Toulouse&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/FVAmbDuqbGfFkZzM6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Link to Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Boynik will discuss example Yugoslav experimental poetry through specific historical and political context of socialist Yugoslavia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sickle of Syntax &amp;amp; Hammer of Tautology offers the first English-language overview of the history of the production of concrete and visual poetry in socialist Yugoslavia between 1968 and 1983. By focusing on mass-produced examples of concrete poetry, the publication presents these poetic experiments as organically linked to social movements, critical theories, and youth cultural revolutions. In his presentation, Boynik, will discuss the concrete and visual poetry in socialist Yugoslavia as an uneven and combined development, and emphasize its confrontational and organizational aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Among others the publication includes accounts on the early years of OHO formation and its complex theories of words and things; an interview with Rastko Mo\u010dnik on programmed art and political formalism; militant polemics of Goran Babi\u0107; Signalist contradictions; subjective structural devices of Judita &amp;Scaron;algo; zaum experiments of Vojislav Despotov; detective meta-texts of Slavoj \u017di\u017eek; poetic self-management studies of Vujica Re&amp;scaron;in Tuci\u0107; a feminist historicization of A\u017ein school for experimental poetry; democratization of visual poetry by Westeast; selections from special issues of the journals Pitanja, Problemi, Ulaznica, Dometi, Delo, Koraci, Vidik, Pegaz, and many other materials translated into English for the first time and presented in one publication.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this newest essay, &lt;em&gt;Universaliser: L&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute; par les voies d&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute;,&lt;/em&gt; he argues that universalism can be conceived as a dialogue among different cultures in a way that recognizes and values these differences as equal contributions to the whole. No region in the world can claim to define universalism and impose its definition on the rest of the world. Thinking about humanity as a whole is infinitely difficult, and it requires a philosophy of de-centering and the elimination of cultural hierarchies to forge together, as equals, a collective conception of the universal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a time when ethnonationalism, tribal identities, and the violent domination of some countries and peoples over others are rising all around us, Souleymane Bachir Diagne retains his faith in humanity and defends universalism as a collective project for all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Souleymane Bachir Diagne&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor Philosophy and French at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Mame-Fatou Niang&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French Studies, the Founder | Director of the Center for Black European Studies at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Dodman&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French and Director of the History and Literature Program at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/242136046951151\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

In this film screening and discussion series, we will process this flood of images by attending to a particularly influential period of their production: the 1950s to 1980s. This period saw the return of location filming to the city and the reconceptualization of dirt as grit. Over the course of the fall, we will watch and discuss six films that exemplify six different ways in which these images have transformed our understanding of New York City.\u00a0\u00a0***All screenings are on Fridays at 7pm***- September 13 - Voyeur NYC: Rear Window (dir.

    "description": "The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict has provoked many emotions (rage, guilt, victimization, condemnation), and a sense of hopelessness for its resolution. It is important to understand that the tragic events of the past year have occurred in the context of an intractable conflict. Intractable conflicts are characterized by master narratives that explain and justify the conflict for both sides. They support the necessity of the conflict as a zero-sum game. They also demonize the enemy and provide the set of arguments that is often associated with religious and moral superiority.This series is faculty-led and will explore the current Israel/Palestine conflict through the dynamics of intractability which includes psychological, historical and political components. We will hear the voices of both Israelis and Palestinian experts on the conflict, psychologists who study the relational effects of these master narratives, and hear from activists, local and international ones, who propose alternatives in this dismal landscape. These events are also organized to fulfill the mission of a University meant to prepare students through education, knowledge, and dialogue.  The seminars is collated by faculty members Warren Spielberg (NSPE) and Benoit Challand (NSSR).\u00a0Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

Chinese description follows English description below.This free 10-week online seminar offers a series of timely debates conducted in Chinese and aimed at a global Chinese audience, focusing on important and controversial issues in Chinese politics and international relations that cannot be freely discussed inside China. In each 90-minute session, guest debaters who are authorities in the subject area will be randomly assigned to present pro and con positions on the following propositions; the audience will vote on each proposition before the debate and at the end of the debate, and will also have a chance to pose questions.\u00a0We hope to help Chinese in China and around the world think through their own positions on a variety of issues facing China at home and abroad.Debate topics include:\u00a01. Democracy is suitable for China2. The China Model works well; it should be emulated by other countries3. The majority of Chinese people support the Chinese Communist Party4. China\u2019s long-term strategic goal is to overthrow the rule-based international order5. The West\u2019s engagement policy toward China was a failure6.

    "description": "Anchored around John Adams' challenging and seldom performed \"Grand Pianola Music\", this exciting program features works by some of our greatest composers of Latin and American music.With the support of a full wind ensemble throughout, this program dances between varied Spanish, American, and Latin American styles all originating from the last century. The Spanish/Latin compositions by Rodrigo and Piazzolla center around traditional clave rhythms. Copland's \"Quiet City\" works with rhythmic freedom and lush, open chords that support the solo voices of trumpet and english horn. This \"American\" sound is also evident in the use of Adams' harmonic language, coupled with a minimalistic, yet complex, rhythmic drive. The addition of two harmonious pianos and 3 voices give new range to the sound of a wind ensemble, making \"Grand Pianola Music\" a unique, masterful composition like no other.\u00a0Program-Adagio Para Orquesta de Instrumentos de Viento - Joaqu\u00edn RodrigoQuiet City - Aaron CoplandTanguango - Astor Piazzolla (arr.

    "description": "Please join us for a conversation with Colin Stearns, Associate Professor of Photography at Parsons School of Design and 2024-25 GIDEST Faculty Fellow. A photographer dedicated to the form of the photobook, Colin will be presenting work from\u00a0\u201cThe Line,\u201d his ongoing project of walking, researching, and photographing the Mason-Dixon Line.\u00a0\u201cThe Line\u201d oscillates between exploring the deep historical significance of the Mason-Dixon Line, understanding the current realities of living near this mythic border of freedom, and reflecting on Colin's own identity as someone who identifies as a southerner. The research started in the early years of the Presidency of Barack Obama and has continued through the current Biden administration.\u00a0Colin has authored photobooks published by RITA BOOKS (2015) and KGP+ (2017). In 2018, he began self-publishing his work to explore publishing as an art form. In 2021, he founded Nonlinear Books, an experimental publishing venture aimed at advancing the form, function, and language of the photobook. The primary focus of Nonlinear Books is addressing issues surrounding race, patriarchy, and disenfranchisement. A central tenet of this initiative is ensuring affordability for all, while also prioritizing support for underrepresented photobook makers.Colin's photobooks are included in collections at prominent institutions including The International Center of Photography Library, The New York Public Library, The New School Library, Ronald Feldman Gallery, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, The Sloane Art Library at the University of North Carolina, and the Hellenic Centre for Photography in Athens, Greece.\u00a0This seminar is a discussion of a pre-circulated work. It can be found on the GIDEST site for attendees to read in advance.\u00a0This event is part of the bi-weekly GIDEST Seminars presented by the\u00a0Graduate Institute for Design, Ethnography & Social Thought.",

The panel is part of a series of public events coinciding\u00a0 with our current exhibition, Regeneration of Flax: Linseed, Linen, Shive & Oil at the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, 66 Fifth Avenue at 13th Street, New York.\u00a0With 60% of textile fibers made of synthetic polyester today, we look to the robust history of flax growing over the last 36,000 years, as a viable biobased alternative to synthetics.\u00a0 Flax is grown as a rotational crop and sequesters carbon as it grows. Flax fibers create linen fabrics, composites and insulation. Flax seed can be a food, or pressed into oils for finishes and flooring. Shive, a woody byproduct, is used for mulch and being researched for flaxlime.\u00a0 We will discuss the methods of farming organically and the potential of flax to remove heavy metals from soil. Experts will discuss the challenges of scaling, applications in the built environment\u00a0 and the benefits of local material sourcing for regional economies.\u00a0\u00a0What if designers were more connected with agriculture and the lifecycle of their materials?\u00a0The panel will be held from 5-6:30pm.\u00a0 The exhibition opening and reception 6:30-8pm.\u00a0RSVP Today!",

In so doing, it aims to provide macro theorists with an apparatus that allows consistent description of both short-term (levels of activity) and long-term (rates of growth) macro outcomes in a manner that routinely integrates feminist insights regarding the gendered structure of the social reproduction of labor into macroeconomic analysis.Non-New School community members: Please register to get access to the buildings, as those that don't and are not on the RSVP list may be refused by security.",

DIRECT ACTION is a contemporary portrait of one of the most high-profile militant activist communities in France: a 150-person strong rural collective that successfully resisted an international airport expansion project in 2018, created an autonomous zone between 2012 and 2018, survived multiple violent eviction attempts by the French state and spawned a new ecological movement in 2021.\u00a0Using a collaborative and immersive observational approach, the film documents the everyday lives of a diverse ecosystem of activists, squatters, anarchists, farmers and those labelled by the government as \u201ceco-terrorists\u201d. Can the success of a radical protest movement offer a path through the climate crisis?\u00a0Filmmakers Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau will discuss their new film.

    "title": "Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico Book Launch",
    "description": "Book launch of Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico, including panel discussion and reception.The Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico documents and analyzes the diversity of collective memory projects throughout Mexico since the start of the \u201cwar against drug cartels\u201d, in a context of various intersecting and ongoing forms of violence. There are now\u00a0more than 110,000 victims of enforced disappearance and the numbers grow every month. Memorialization has been acknowledged as an important tool in the context of mass human rights violations and is often seen as a symbolic form of reparation for the victims, predominantly after regime change or a clearly-defined end to large scale violence. Compared to other cases in Latin America and other parts of the world, this has not been the case in Mexico. The scholars, activists, families of victims, architects and artists that write in this book address the pressing questions that emerge from the particularity of the Mexican case: Why would activists use the language and aesthetics of commemoration in the midst of ongoing violence and human rights abuses? What is the function of commemoration in the absence of peace and justice? What does it mean to commemorate in the absence of evidence and in the absence of bodies (i.e. in the case of the disappeared)?The Struggles for Memory examines historical connections across mobilizations around collective memory in Mexico in the context of the dirty war of the 1960s and 1970s and recent events from the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa in 2014, to the women who search for mass graves around the country, among a number of other memorialization efforts around the country, some well-known and others not so widely disseminated. The book challenges the framing of the violence merely as an issue related to drugs and organized crime. These interventions show the continuities in state violence over time, drawing attention to forms of structural violence that cut across enforced disappearances, violence against women, migrant deaths, resource extraction, attacks on activists and journalists, and the enduring discrimination against indigenous peoples and the dispossession of their lands.

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Klaus Vieweg, \"Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics of Painting\"",
    "description": "Abstract: What connects Hegel with Rembrandt? What are the important points of contact between the grand master of modern philosophizing and the virtuosos of Dutch painting? Why does Hegel, as an outstanding representative of the school of German Idealism, the golden age of modern philosophy, recognize in the paintings of Rembrandt and the Dutch school of the Golden Age a greatness of spirit and freedom, a revolution in painting, the modernity of this art of painting? Why is Hegel fascinated by such pictures of proud citizens, vegetable and herring sellers, street urchins, the poor and beggars, landscapes and Dutch mills, farmers at harvest and in the inn, women playing the piano, canals with skaters, bouquets of flowers and breakfast tables - depictions of seemingly banal scenes of everyday life?By laying the foundations for a modern aesthetic theory in his lectures on the philosophy of art, Hegel provides decisive arguments against classicist and romanticist devaluations of Dutch Golden Age painting. Against the glorification of antiquity (classicism) and the Christian Middle Ages (late romanticism), his philosophy of art brought about a paradigm shift towards the art of modernity as free art, an art of free spirituality - \"only in its freedom is beautiful art true art\". Hegel can be regarded as the founder of a modern aesthetic of painting in the sense of combining philosophy and art history.Bio: Klaus Vieweg is Professor of Classical German Philosophy at the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena and one of the world's leading Hegel experts. Vieweg has authored or edited over two dozen books, including Hegel. Der Philosophie der Freiheit (Munich: 2019) translated into English as Hegel: The Philosopher of Freedom (Stanford 2023).",

In this program, the ensemble returns to their roots to celebrate music from their hometown, including Wherein Lies the Good, an expansive work by Robin Holcomb originally written for solo piano, as well as works by her contemporaries Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, and Ron Miles.\u00a0Repertoire to include:Wherein Lies the Good \u2014 Robin HolcombSweeter Than The Day \u2014 Wayne HorvitzCupid \u2014 Ron MilesMonroe \u2014 Bill Frisell\u00a0All arrangements by The Westerlies.The Westerlies are the Ensemble-in-Residence at the\u00a0School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School College of Performing Arts\u00a0\u00a0Free with registration / Space is Limited!\u00a0The Westerlies:The Westerlies, \u201can arty quartet\u2026mixing ideas from jazz, new classical, and Appalachian folk\u201d (New York Times) are a New York-based brass quartet comprised of Riley Mulherkar and Chloe Rowlands on trumpet, and Andy Clausen and Addison Maye-Saxon on trombone. From Carnegie Hall to Coachella, The Westerlies navigate a wide array of venues and projects with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family sing-along.Formed in 2011, the self-described \u201caccidental brass quartet\u201d takes its name from the prevailing winds that travel from the West to the East. \u201cSkilled interpreters who are also adept improvisers\u201d (NPR\u2019s Fresh Air), The Westerlies explore jazz, roots, and chamber music influences to create the rarest of hybrids: music that is both \"folk-like and composerly, lovely and intellectually rigorous\u201d (NPR Music).The ensemble has produced numerous critically acclaimed albums of genre-defying music. 2022 saw the release of the Songbook Vol. 2 and Live at TOURISTS on Westerlies Records, the ensemble\u2019s in-house record label. The previous year was a prolific year for the ensemble, with the release of Fireside Brass: A Westerlies Holiday (Westerlies Records), Songbook Vol. 1 (Westerlies Records), and Bricolage (Westerlies Records), a collaborative album of improvisations with pianist/composer Conrad Tao. 2021 also saw the release of This Land, the ensemble\u2019s collaboration with GRAMMY-nominated vocalist Theo Bleckmann. Sought-after collaborators, The Westerlies are also featured on recordings by Fleet Foxes (Nonesuch), Big Red Machine (Jagjaguwar), Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 (Six Degrees Records), Common (Lakeshore) and Dave Douglas (Greenleaf).Education and community engagement are core elements of The Westerlies' mission. In 2021, The Westerlies were named the inaugural small ensemble-in-residence at the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School. The Westerlies also produce an annual music festival in Seattle called Westerlies Fest, which combines evening performances featuring numerous guest artists, an all-day open-to-the-public creative music jamboree, and workshops in local public schools. The Westerlies have engaged students of all ages and abilities around the country with their innovative assemblies and masterclasses, promoting the values of cooperation and inclusion through music.This performance will be LIVESTREAMED.

If we are smart, we listen, we follow these murmurs and we see where they lead.\u00a0 Jon-Sesrie Goff does just that in After Sherman. His florid documentary eavesdrops on fragmented dialogues: between father and son, among friends and neighbors, between land and river and, of course, between the past and the present. These conversations are ambitiously framed by the director, in his notes, as meditations on inheritance and our nation\u2019s twisted history. And while After Sherman fulfills that mission, it\u2019s most captivating when it burrows into Goff\u2019s personal history, recording the stories and rituals of his Gullah Geechee community\u201d \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarke",

    "title": "Heuss Lecture | Christina Morina, \"A Thousand New Beginnings: Germans\u00a0and Their Democracy since the 1980s\"",
    "description": "\u00a0What motivates the federal republic? Nearly 75 years since its creation and more than thirty since reunification, German democracy is under pressure: political extremism is spreading, the major political parties are battling vanishing approval ratings, and resentment and anti-democratic feelings are on the rise. How did we get here?Renowned historian Christina Morina believes that to understand modern German history, we need to stop thinking of it as a straightforward story of democracy and dictatorship. In her new book,\u00a0Tausend Aufbr\u00fcche (A Thousand New Beginnings, English edition in preparation for 2025), she examines countless letters to politicians, petitions, leaflets and other documents to show how citizenship and democracy have meant different things to different people over the past 40 years. For the first time, this\u00a0political-cultural history of modern Germany looks at the 1989 revolution in light of the history of German democracy \u2013 revealing the diverse and stubborn ways in which Germans from all walks of life, east and west, have approached democracy in theory and in practice, how their ideas are shaping the so-called Berlin Republic, and the associated opportunities and dangers.Christina Morina is the 2024-2025 Visiting Heuss Professor in History at The New School for Social Research. She is Professor of General History with a particular focus on Contemporary History at the University of Bielefeld. Her research focuses on major themes in German and European history from the in 19th to the 21st century, particularly Nazism and the history of bystanding during the Holocaust; socialism, Marxism and communism; political and memory culture(s) in Germany since 1945, as well as the history of historiography.This annual Heuss Lecture is part of The New School for Social Research's General Seminar event series.

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

Please click here to register for Day Two on October 18.The world is spiraling into climate chaos, and artificial intelligence (AI), despite its apparent promise, threatens democratic institutions the world over. What is driving the current race to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI? Why are tech billionaires like Elon Musk so obsessed with colonizing space and anxious about population decline? One aim of this symposium is to better understand the mindsets, both utopian and apocalyptic, that have become pervasive within Silicon Valley and beyond. We will consider a cluster of interrelated ideologies that inform these mindsets, among others, Effective Altruism (EA), transhumanism, longtermism, effective accelerationism, and singularitarianism.

    "description": "The Arendt/Sh\u00fcrmann Symposium at the Philosophy Department of The New School for Social Research present this\u00a0two-day conference running October 17-18, 2024. Please click here to register for Day One on October 17.The world is spiraling into climate chaos, and artificial intelligence (AI), despite its apparent promise, threatens democratic institutions the world over. What is driving the current race to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI? Why are tech billionaires like Elon Musk so obsessed with colonizing space and anxious about population decline? One aim of this symposium is to better understand the mindsets, both utopian and apocalyptic, that have become pervasive within Silicon Valley and beyond. We will consider a cluster of interrelated ideologies that inform these mindsets, among others, Effective Altruism (EA), transhumanism, longtermism, effective accelerationism, and singularitarianism. We hope to identify meaningful and effective strategies to counteract their growing influence.\u00a0Speakers: Amitav Ghosh, Tyler A.

    "description": "In China, recent reforms have aimed at expanding social security coverage, improving healthcare, and addressing rural-urban disparities. India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance. ",

    "description": "Political modernity set off, through liberalism and a modern form of republicanism, programmatically and historically, with a rather oligarchical and abstract perspective. Accordingly, most citizens \u2013 if they were citizens at all \u2013 did not participate, at least fully, in the political system and had only civil rights \u2013 limited in particular for women but also for specific groups of the population, foremostly slaves. Abstractness hid however these concrete issues, besetting workers and the popular classes in general, as well as women, also in their plebeian political being. Abstractness implied also the personalization and personification of politics should be strictly limited. Through social and political struggles concreteness penetrated however the structure of the state, democratizing the political system of liberal republicanism, broadening political rights, and introducing social policies and rights, tending often to universalization. Highly oligarchical mass organizations \u2013 parties, unions, associations, churches \u2013 were crucial for this expansive moment. This movement has been reversed since the 1970s, implying a moment of retraction of republican liberalism towards a sort of de-democratized advanced oligarchical political system, despite the formal trappings of democracy, and the restriction of social policies, concentrated on the poor rather them aiming at the citizen. Concreteness has not disappeared, though, with society cut out in different groups and the personalization and personification of politics (so-called \u201cpopulism\u201d). This movement is internal rather than inimical to liberalism. At the same time, the \u201creal socialist\u201d (authoritarian collectivism) failed and returned to capitalism, although keeping the party-state form. It does not appear any longer as an alternative at all. The question that remains is whether republican liberalism can resume its expansive movement or whether, as authoritarian collectivism, it is exhausted in its creative capacities and historical dynamics and in terms of propelling social forces.",

    "title": "Pleistocene Park: Engineering Wilderness in a More-than-Human World",
    "description": "Pleistocene Park is a large-scale science experiment in Arctic Siberia in the form of a future-oriented rewilding project with the goal of mitigating climate change. The Park\u2019s creators hypothesize that introducing large herbivores into the area will slow the thawing of permafrost. Using the approach of multispecies ethnography, in attending to the nonhuman agencies at work in the project, Anya Bernstein (Harvard) argues that the Park differs from other rewilding projects, which are usually ecocentric, in emerging as a survivalist project with a distinct anthropocentric bent. Even so, however, the Park\u2019s survivalist goal for humans coexists with ontologies based on collaboration and mutual aid between humans and nonhumans, and between organic and inorganic matter, with extensive agency assigned to nonhuman others. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork within the frame of the Park\u2019s various genealogies, she traces the project\u2019s underlying assumptions in equal measure to the history of Russian science and to the experience of the Park\u2019s lead scientists of sociopolitical rupture following the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a case study, Pleistocene Park is especially suited to exploring issues of time and temporality, apocalypticism and redemption, extinction and eternity, in addition to particular visions of the natural and the human.",

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Mohamed Amer Meziane, \"Of Subterranean\u00a0Imperiality:\u00a0Heaven, Earth, and the Accumulation of Capital\"",
    "description": "How is the State involved in the climate crisis?\u00a0Drawing on\u00a0The States of the Earth\u00a0(Verso, 2024), Mohamed Amer Meziane (Brown University) will attempt to develop a theory of what he calls the Fossil State, partly based on a critical dialogue with Marxism\u00a0that differs from most eco-socialist perspectives. He will suggest that the concept of\u00a0imperiality (not coloniality) might help us analyze the theologico-political knot underpinning the modern capitalist State in both its religious and secular forms. Because the State never exists as an isolated entity but as part of a system of interconnected states, I will turn to inter-imperiality to describe aspects of the geopolitics of climate beyond the opposition between war and peace. By reinterpreting \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d in terms not only of State/colonial violence but of imperial secularization (not secularism), he thus wants to contribute to a different understanding of the entanglements of colonialism and capital and to try and find overlaps between eco-Marxist and anti-colonial approaches.Bio:\u00a0Mohamed Amer Meziane holds a PhD in Philosophy and Intellectual History from the University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. After teaching at Columbia University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life, he joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor of Francophone Humanities and Middle East Studies affiliated with the Watson Institute. He is the author of The States of the Earth: An Ecological and Racial History of Secularization. The book won the Albertine Prize for non-fiction in 2023 and was published in English in April 2024 by Verso Books. His second book was published in French in 2023. It is titled: Au bord des mondes. Vers une anthropologie m\u00e9taphysique (At the Edge of the Worlds: Towards a Metaphysical Anthropology).\u00a0His books have been reviewed in several media such as Le Monde, Mediapart and The Los Angeles Review Books. He is also invited to write texts about several contemporary artists for exhibitions catalogs, art galleries or journals such as Flash Art. ",

VLC Borderlands Curatorial Fellow Larissa Nez (Din\u00e9) introduces and moderates the conversation to ask: How can artists and historians correct or produce a \u201ccorrect\u201d record of Indigenous histories?
