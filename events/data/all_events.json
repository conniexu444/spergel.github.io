Despite great promise, we have yet to harness the high-resolution information on cell states and fates that single-cell genomics data offer to understand cell fate decisions. Nor do we know in most cases how these decisions are controlled by gene regulatory networks. I will describe our recent work in constructing models of cell fate networks via the multiscale coupling of networks at two levels: cell-cell communication and of gene regulatory states. Through analysis of combination therapies for metastatic breast cancer, we have discovered new mechanisms by which modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment can improve patient outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam MacLean develops theory to understand cell fate decision-making in stem cells and cancer. He has developed models of cell-cell communication, and the gene regulatory networks that control cell fate decisions via single-cell multi-omics data analysis and statistical inference. He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, at the University of Southern California. He studied mathematical physics (BSc) at the University of Edinburgh, and completed a PhD in systems biology from Imperial College London. He worked as a postdoc at the University of Oxford and the University of California Irvine, before joining USC in 2019. Recent awards for his work include an NSF CAREER award (2022) and an NIH R35 MIRA award (2022).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/242136046951151\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turbocharging Profits? Contract Gaming and Revenue Allocation in Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-authors: Atul Gupta (University of Pennsylvania) and Ambar La Forgia (UC Berkeley)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Firms often exploit loopholes in government contracts to boost revenues. The welfare consequences of this behavior depend on how firms use the marginal windfall dollar, yet little evidence exists to guide policymakers. This paper studies how hospitals allocated over $3 billion obtained from gaming a Medicare payment loophole. The average gaming hospital increased both Medicare and total revenue by around 10%, implying large spillovers on other payers. Consistent with theories of organizational behavior, nonprofit hospitals deployed most of the windfall toward operating costs, while for-profits deducted the entire amount off their balance sheet, distributing a substantial portion to executives and shareholders. Accordingly, we detect modest reductions in mortality rates at nonprofits but no changes at for-profits. Our results imply that the consequences of such engineered windfalls vary substantially by hospital ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Sacarny&amp;#39;s research explores the relationship between health care payment policy, provider and patient decision-making, and clinical quality. Much of this work involves using randomized controlled trials to test interventions in the health care delivery system. His research on health care providers has studied the effects of behavioral interventions on overprescribing, the adoption of hospital documentation and coding practices, and the relationship between hospital clinical outcomes and market share.&lt;/p&gt;",

Developing a coherent alternative will require fresh thinking that spans philosophy, economics and political science.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This timely conversation hosted by the &lt;a href=\"https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/our-work/center-political-economy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Political Economy&lt;/a&gt; will bring together a panel of scholars to explore the ideas that could shape a new economic paradigm. In his new book &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/book\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free and Equal: A Manifesto for a Just Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, economist and philosopher Daniel Chandler looks to the ideas of political philosopher John Rawls to reinvigorate liberalism and develop a new model of capitalism that would genuinely work for all. But is Rawls the thinker we need right now? What would a truly just economy look like? And how could we bring it about?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our panel will include &lt;a href=\"https://www.danielchandler.co.uk/home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Chandler&lt;/a&gt; (London School of Economics), &lt;a href=\"https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/daniel-luban\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daniel Luban&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) and &lt;a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/alex-raskolnikov\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alex Raskolnikov&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia). &lt;a href=\"https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/communities-connections/faculty/suresh-naidu\"&gt;Suresh Naidu&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia) will chair and moderate the discussion.&amp;nbsp;This program is brought to you in partnership with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/socialenterprise\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tamer Institute for Social Enterprise and Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This panel will take place in the Foyer&amp;nbsp;on the second floor of the Forum. Check-in will begin at 5:30 p.m. in the Forum&amp;#39;s West Atrium&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The event is open to the public, subject to registration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And a key focus in pursuit of that goal is advancing its science and technological abilities. China has made impressive advancements in the last 5-10 years in scientific research, and the technological content of the products it exports around the world, including to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Series will explore the current and near-term status of Chinese technological abilities and the continuing impacts this will have on the U.S. economy and military capabilities. Presentations by distinguished speakers are followed by ample time for questions and discussion. The social hour and dinner provide additional opportunities to meet the speakers, renew acquaintances, or join in stimulating discussions with other participants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each session begins at 6:15 PM on the second floor of Maggiano&amp;rsquo;s with a cash bar, followed by dinner at 7:00 PM, and the presentation from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The registration fee for the Series is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;$275 for ColumbiaDC members&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes all dinners.

This is a new opportunity and space is limited. &lt;strong&gt;A registration link will be shared with all participants in the Essentials series this term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this Practice Teaching session, CTL will pair you with a trained peer facilitator and a group of about 3 other graduate students in the Essentials series. Together, you and your fellow participants will take turns delivering short (&amp;lt;7 min.) samples of instruction to each other and practice putting into action the concepts and strategies discussed in the Essentials series. After each teaching sample, your facilitator and your peers will offer structured feedback to support your teaching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new offering is an opportunity&amp;nbsp;to try out the application of an approach or technique learned during the Essentials series. Participation in this Practice Teaching session is also a great way to make some quick headway on the CTL&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://tdp.ctl.columbia.edu/\"&gt;Teaching Development Program (TDP)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as this session satisfies the Application and Practice requirement of the Foundational Track.

Contrary to this common view, emotion and affect are integral to the development of comparative law, particularly through the lens of the US-China relationship, which can be characterized as &amp;quot;adversarial comparativism.&amp;quot; Rather than using law to emulate or learn from one another, the US and China engage in legal strategies aimed at outmaneuvering each other. This dynamic is evident in China&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of US-style extraterritoriality and the development of China-related property regimes by US state governments. These examples of adversarial comparativism illustrate how emotion drives legal frameworks in the context of a US-China rivalry, offering insight into the increasingly fragmented landscape of international law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is organized by the &lt;a href=\"https://chinese-legal-studies.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hong Yen Chang Center for Chinese Legal Studies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and co-sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"https://parker-school.law.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Parker School of Foreign &amp;amp; Comparative Law &lt;/a&gt;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.jtl.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Columbia Journal of Transnational Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew S.

However, most of the new historiographers adopt a restricted Americo-Eurocentric Perspective that disregards events and peoples in the rest of the world as makers of human rights history. For many in the Global South, the Western &amp;quot;rediscovery&amp;quot; of human rights in the 1970s looks more like retrenchment and repossession, part of a larger &amp;quot;rollback&amp;quot; on Third World agendas to decolonize and reshape the international order. This same period also saw an increased use of airline hijackings as a tactic of national liberation movements, which helped to speed a reversal in the official discourse on &amp;quot;terrorism.&amp;quot; Together, these forces facilitated a neoliberal hijacking of human rights that delegitimized national self-determination, narrowed international concern to the plight of individual political prisoners, and realigned the moral economy of human rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This series offers student-led conversations on human rights and social justice issues, examined through the work of ISHR faculty. Participants are asked to read the research in advance.&amp;nbsp;Light lunch will be served.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Registration is required for this event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Philosophy Hall Room 302&lt;/p&gt;",

The monthly seminars take place on the second Wednesday of the month, 2:00-3:00 PM EST. The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, October 9th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Carlos Carmona-Fontaine, Associate Professor of Biology, New York University. Seminar hosted by Simon Tavar&amp;eacute;. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus). If you wish to attend the seminar remotely, please register using the following link: &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0td-6qrz0qG9Bq0heUQR-6XAZoC7ZkfE_6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0td-6qrz0qG9Bq0heUQR-6XAZoC7ZkfE_6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title: &lt;/strong&gt;Modeling Social Cell Struggles in Cancer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Tumor evolution is shaped by cell competition and cooperation. While competition in cancer is widely studied, the role of cell cooperation and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their size falls below a critical tipping point. I will present our recent work where we sought to identify cooperative mechanisms in cancer so that we can exploit them and drive tumor populations to this critical point. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyzes these peptides, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperation to scavenge nutrients is key to survive in the tumor microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability. I will also present additional mathematical and experimental models showing how we can use insights from ecology to better understand the tumor&lt;br /&gt;\nmicroenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Carlos Carmona-Fontaine is an Associate Professor of Biology and member of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. He holds a PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology from University College London, UK and a BSc in Biological Sciences from Chile. The main interest of his laboratory is to understand how cells organize to form multicellular structures and to coordinate in collective processes. Multicellular is important during physiological processes such as embryonic development but it is also critical in cancer and other diseases. The work of his lab suggests that a large part of this organization emerges from social and ecological interactions between cells that are mediated by metabolites &amp;ndash; nutrients and waste products of cellular activity. Prior to joining the faculty at NYU, Carlos was an independent research fellow at the Computational Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He received a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award during his postdoctoral research and was awarded the Beddington Medal for his doctoral studies. As faculty member he received a number of grants including a DP2 New Innovator Award from the NIH, a Pew Biomedical Fellowship, and an American Cancer Society research fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibility via zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

In the United States, one in three babies is born via C-section, a rate that has grown exponentially over the past fifty years. While in most cases the procedure is safe, it is not without significant, sometimes life-changing consequences, many of which affect people of color disproportionately. Invisible Labor lifts the veil on C-sections so that people can make choices about pregnancy and surgical birth with greater knowledge of the risks, benefits, and alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rachel Somerstein will be in conversation with Dr. Christopher Travis, MD, MS, an alumnx of the Columbia Narrative Medicine masters program and Assistant Professor and Assistant Education Director for Narrative Medicine in the Department of OB/GYN at University Hospitals/Case Western Reserve University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Romantic period&amp;#39;s upheaval cast both traditional communal organizations of life and outgrowths of the new revolutionary age into crisis. In this context, Joseph Albernaz argues that Romantic writers articulate a vital conception of &amp;quot;groundless community,&amp;quot; while following this idea through its aesthetic, ecological, political, and philosophical registers into the present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst the violent expropriation of the commons, Romantic writers including the Wordsworths, Clare, H&amp;ouml;lderlin, and the revolutionary abolitionist Robert Wedderburn reimagined the forms of their own lives through literature to conceive community as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;groundless&lt;/em&gt;, a disposition toward radically open forms of sharing&amp;mdash;including with nonhuman beings&amp;mdash;without recourse to any collective identity. Both a poetics and ethics, groundless community names an everyday sociality that surges beneath and against the enclosures of property and identity, binding us to the movements of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unearthing Romanticism&amp;#39;s intersections with the history of communism and the general strike, Albernaz also demonstrates how Romantic literature&amp;#39;s communal imagination reverberates through later theories of community in Bataille, Derrida, Nancy, Moten, and others. With sharp close readings, new historical constellations, and innovative theoretical paradigms,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Common Measures&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;recasts the relationship of the Romantic period to the basic terms of modernity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/joseph-albernaz\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Joseph Albernaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. He specializes in the literature, especially poetry, of the Romantic period, with a particular interest in the legacies of Romanticism across a number of theoretical and critical domains. His first book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Common Measures: Romanticism and the Groundlessness of Community&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Stanford University Press, 2024), reads writers from Geneva to Jamaica to trace new formations of community, ecology, and the every day in Romantic literature and its later inheritors. Broadly speaking, his recent work seeks to place close and comparative literary analysis in convergent dialogue with philosophical inquiry and with historical trajectories of insurgency and revolt. He is currently working on a second book, tentatively entitled &amp;quot;The Time Torn Remnant of the Holiday,&amp;quot; on calendars, festivals, work, temporality, and rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for in-person &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrating-recent-work-by-joseph-albernaz-tickets-1001528527787?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register for Zoom &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_WXr-XYsGT6SqUReaVw_Jpg#/registration\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Born into precarious freedom after the American Revolution and reaching adulthood in the lead-up to the Civil War, this remarkable generation ultimately played an outsized role in political and legal conflicts over slavery&amp;rsquo;s future, influencing both the nation&amp;rsquo;s path to the Civil War and changes to the US Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The Rising Generation&lt;/em&gt; shows how, as the children of gradual abolition reached adulthood, they took the lessons of their youth into midcentury campaigns for legal equality, political inclusion, equitable common school education, and the expansion of freedom across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;",

The risks of fiscal crisis and/or hyperinflation are increasing. Unfair burdens will be placed on younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3) Japan is struggling to proceed with decarbonization, lagging in transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and EV).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The annual lecture details these challenges and presents recommendations for remedies and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takatoshi Ito&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, has taught extensively both in the United States and Japan since finishing his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University in 1979.

In the 1930s,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralistas&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;envisioned creating what they called a Christian holistic state (&lt;em&gt;Estado Integral&lt;/em&gt;), in which corporatism, nationalism, and faith would sustain the country&amp;rsquo;s very existence in opposition to communism, materialism, and liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Offering a fresh analytical framework to this history, Traldi argues that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralistas&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;were able to meaningfully re-group after the Era of Fascism, and that women emerged as key socio-political agents for the &amp;ldquo;reinvention&amp;rdquo; of Brazilian Integralismo from Latin America&amp;rsquo;s largest fascist movement of the 1930s to an influential far-right Christian nationalist group after the mid-1940s. Drawing from largely unexplored sources, such as correspondence, iconographic material, private collections, and oral histories, and building from important scholarship of Latin America, Traldi shows how gender, fascism, and religion appeared as intertwined, complex categories of analysis especially during the Cold War in Latin America. Also, her talk raises an alarm in the present: the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Integralista&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;recipe of God, Fatherland, Family lasted much longer than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Register &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/god-fatherland-family-integralismo-and-the-far-right-in-brazil-tickets-1001456903557?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Edward Nunes and Aimee Campbell, who have run studies testing therapeutic apps, will engage Dr. Marsch in a discussion providing an overview of the landscape of technology and substance/mental health treatment, and engage the audience to brainstorm on potential future directions and projects.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The final years of the Third Reich witnessed the rise of a radical strain of chronopolitical discourse suggesting that a German defeat would spell the very end of history. History had only come into being under Hitler and it would perish with him. Ultimately, the war was a gigantic fireworks display in which a fatally accelerated &amp;quot;time without precedent&amp;quot; (Goebbels) was using up all its historical energy. This radical strain was there from the beginning of Nazism and survived its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The talk will analyze its peculiar logic by tracing and connecting several manifestations: the notion of terminal performance underlying the widespread abuse of the methamphetamine Pervitin; the idea of compressed morbidity guiding the future plans of Nazi insurance agencies to advocate a policy of senicide; the early literary prefiguration of the monopolization of history by the Third Reich in Katharine Burdekin&amp;#39;s 1937 dystopia Swastika Night; Hans Blumenberg&amp;#39;s philosophical take on Hitler&amp;#39;s final days; and, most importantly, the post-Stalingrad rhetoric of Joseph Goebbels, who in the wake of Hitler&amp;#39;s increasing absence becomes the principal purveyor of the Nazi chronobscene.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geoffrey Winthrop-Young&lt;/strong&gt; (MA Freiburg, PhD UBC) is Professor of German and Nordic Studies at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* Reception to follow&lt;/p&gt;",

In her work, Tabassum seeks to establish a language of architecture that is contemporary yet reflectively rooted to place, always against an ecological rubric containing climate, context, culture, history. Her project the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque in Bangladesh is distinguished by its lack of popular mosque iconography, its emphasis on space and light, and its capacity to function not only as a place of worship but also as a refuge for a dense neighborhood on Dhaka&amp;rsquo;s periphery. The portfolio of work notwithstanding, Tabassum&amp;rsquo;s practice remains consciously contained in size, undertaking a limited number of projects per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tabassum is a Professor at Technical University Delft, in the Netherlands. She held the Gehry Chair at the University of Toronto 2022 - 2023. She has taught in Harvard University Graduate School of Design, University of Texas, Bengal Institute and BRAC University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She received an Honorary Doctorate from Technical University of Munich. In addition to Aga Khan Awards for Architecture, she has received many accolades including Arnold Brunner Memorial Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Gold Medal of the French Academy of Architecture and Soane medal in Architecture from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tabassum chairs Foundation for Architecture and Community Equity (F.A.C.E) and Prokritee, a Fare trade organization. She has served as the member of the Steering Committee of the Aga Khan Awards for Architecture from 2017 to 2022. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event content is equivalent to 1.5 AIA/CES total learning credit.

Anooradha&amp;rsquo;s talk will be followed by a response from&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nora Akawi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Cooper Union) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mabel Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;(GSAPP, AAADS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Environments associated with migration are often seen as provisional, lacking both history and architecture. As Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi demonstrates in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration&lt;/em&gt;, a refugee camp&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic and material landscapes&amp;mdash;even if born out of emergency&amp;mdash;reveal histories, futures, politics, and rhetorics. She identifies forces of colonial and humanitarian settlement, tracing spatial and racial politics in the Dadaab refugee camps established in 1991 on the Kenya-Somalia border&amp;mdash;at once a dense setting that manifests decades of architectural, planning, and design initiatives and a much older constructed environment that reflects its own ways of knowing. She moves beyond ahistorical representations of camps and their inhabitants by constructing a material and visual archive of Dadaab, finding long migratory traditions in the architecture, spatial practices, landscapes, and iconography of refugees and humanitarians. Countering conceptualizations of refugee camps as sites of border transgression, criminality, and placelessness, Siddiqi instead theorizes them as complex settlements, ecologies, and material archives created through histories of partition, sedentarization, domesticity, and migration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/3272/Architecture-of-MigrationThe-Dadaab-Refugee-Camps\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Learn more about&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration: The Dadaab Refugee Camps and Humanitarian Settlement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an architectural historian at Barnard College, Columbia University, and author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of Migration: The Dadaab Refugee Camps and Humanitarian Settlement&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Duke University Press), on the spatial politics, ecologies, iconography, visual rhetoric, and long colonial traditions of the UNHCR-administered camps at Dadaab, Kenya. She is the author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minnette De Silva: Intersections&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Mack Books), and her book manuscript&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ecologies of the Past: The Inhabitations and Designs of Anil and Minnette de Silva&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;analyzes the politics of heritage environments through the work of Sri Lankan architect Minnette de Silva and art historian Anil de Silva-Vigier.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Friday 10/18, 1:10pm&amp;ndash;2:25pm, is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb70-9192dd15-0191-9547e0d4-00005197events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Gorelick shows how modern concepts of literature and the unconscious were generated in response to these efforts and by an ethical concern for what the language of the Enlightenment excludes, represses, or struggles to erase. Troubling the idea of the Enlightenment on its own terms, subverting its supposed authority from within, Gorelick thus reveals the workings of unconscious fantasy at the foundations of our contemporary political realities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Unwritten Enlightenment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;makes clear that to criticize the Enlightenment&amp;rsquo;s deficiencies, ambiguities, and legacies of violence without regard for the unconscious fantasies that drive them risks reproducing the very patterns of thought, action, and imagination that the Enlightenment novel already unsettles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.barnard.edu/profiles/nathan-gorelick\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nathan Gorelick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;teaches in the English Department and for the First-Year Experience program at Barnard College.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This year, despite vociferous internal protest, the Subcommission on Quarternary Stratigraphy denied the existence of an Anthropocene epoch as a formal unit of the Geological Time Scale, opting for the looser geological concept of an &amp;ldquo;episode&amp;rdquo;. What began with a bang ended with a whimper&amp;mdash;this was an inauspicious end to a period where so much ink has been spent on a geological concept in the social sciences and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or was it not an ending at all? While geology has formalized timekeeping procedures, the life of a concept in critical scholarship tends to be irresolute, more valued for the questions it raises than the matters it puts to rest. In the name of the Anthropocene, renewed attention to capitalism&amp;rsquo;s terraforming force emerged. New approaches to the multiple temporalities of history and more-than-human assemblages have been devised; new anthropogenic ecologies have been imagined; the boundaries between life and nonlife have become critical problematics. The traffic between earth science and social and humanities scholarship went in several directions. In selecting a &amp;ldquo;golden spike&amp;rdquo; for the Anthropocene, geologists trying to extract a sediment core from a Canadian lake were embroiled in controversies over Indigenous cosmologies and land stewardship, settler colonization, and nuclear fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the dust settles, this panel conducts a post-mortem inquiry for the Anthropocene. Does the geological rejection of the term matter for how humanists should think about relations between the social and the planetary? What did the Anthropocene debacle reveal about epistemic power relations? And where to go now?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/leah-aronowsky\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leah Aronowsky&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Climate at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/elizabeth-povinelli\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elizabeth Povinelli&lt;/a&gt;, Franz Boas Professor of Anthropology and Gender Studies at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/shr7208.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sophia Roosth&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at New York University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-post-mortem-for-the-anthropocene-registration-976730425997\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/valentina-izmirlieva/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scholars of empire have long argued that imperial states frequently borrowed technologies and techniques of governance from each other, often without acknowledging their sources. Others have noted that pre-modern empires did not observe a secular separation of church and state; instead, one invariably finds a complex entanglement of religious and state institutions. This talk seeks to explore the intersection of these two claims in the borderlands of the Russian empire and the Qing empire, as well as those of their respective successors. Through a series of cases from the early modern to contemporary, it seeks to show how representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church selectively adopted political strategies and semiotic forms from other Christian and non-Christian religious traditions through processes of inter-imperial contact and competition. In the course of discussing these cases, the talk will also seek to highlight the role of ostensibly secular state officials in catalyzing these moments of cultural transfer.&lt;/p&gt;",

Du Bois cited informal, Black-led free schools as the most radical innovation of Reconstruction and perhaps its greatest loss as they were institutionalized by its end. This talk tells a new story about the expansion of higher education in the United States, one centered on the struggle for control over schools founded by the formerly enslaved between these communities, the state-run Freedman&amp;rsquo;s Bureau, missionary organizations, and philanthropic foundations. This talk will argue that building campaigns and the negotiation and management of funding, lands, labor, and form reveal the unsettled status of the Black college from an instrument of liberation to one of social control. Beginning with the foundation and early development of the Hampton Institute, which foregrounded education as part of the project of reparations, the talk will build from the legal concept of abandonment as a precondition for new possession to the centrality of land claims, settlement, and separatism in the development of a second campus, the Tuskegee Institute, led by Hampton graduate Booker T.

Since before the passage of CHIPS and Science Act in summer 2022, federal and state governments, companies and universities have stepped up the effort to revitalize the entire semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. We will review Purdue University&amp;rsquo;s initiatives in this area and draw some lessons on universities&amp;rsquo; role in talent development, research moonshots, and public private partnership.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOGRAPHY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMung Chiang is the 13th president of Purdue University and the Roscoe H. George Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He was previously the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering and executive vice president for strategic initiatives at Purdue University, as well as the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chiang founded the Princeton EDGE Lab in 2009 and then founded several startup companies and industry consortia in edge computing. As the Science and Technology Adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State in 2020, he initiated tech diplomacy programs for the U.S. government. Currently he serves on the inaugural board of the U.S. Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation and several corporate and nonprofit boards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chiang received his BS (1999), MS (2000) and PhD (2003) from Stanford University and an honorary doctorate (2024) from Dartmouth College. For his research in communication networks, he received the NSF Alan T. Waterman Award (2013), as well as the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award (2012), the IEEE INFOCOM Achievement Award (2022) and a Guggenheim Fellowship (2014). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences 2024), the National Academy of Inventors (2020) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;On October 18, 2024, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University will convene scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and activists for a symposium about surveillance and censorship and the changing role of the international border.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. government uses its authority over the border to justify the surveillance of social media, the interrogation of travelers about their political and religious views, the warrantless search of travelers&amp;rsquo; laptops and cellphones, the imposition of limits on Americans&amp;rsquo; right to engage with foreign speakers and to access foreign communications platforms, and the suspension of the constitutional rules that would ordinarily apply to the surveillance of Americans&amp;rsquo; emails and telephone calls. Panelists will consider these practices and their implications from a range of perspectives, including theoretical, doctrinal, historical, and empirical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Regardless of Frontiers&amp;rdquo; will also feature a photo exhibition entitled &amp;ldquo;Infrastructures of Control,&amp;rdquo; by&amp;nbsp;Colter Thomas&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Dugan Meyer. Through a series of photographs, the exhibit aims to create a visual archive of security and surveillance infrastructure in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. An opening reception will be held on the evening of October 17 at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will take place at Columbia University and online.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The economic activities of a company can exacerbate the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land and sea use change, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. Direct drivers have impacts on species and ecosystems while affecting people who rely on ecosystem services for their livelihood. In addition, the majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest companies have a significant dependency on nature across their direct operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conversations about biodiversity have focused on ecological conservation efforts, habitat restoration, and on-the-ground fieldwork in specific locations. In recent years, biodiversity reporting frameworks that attempt to capture the total financial impact and dependency of individual corporations have begun to emerge. Frameworks such as TNFD, GRI 101, and ESRS E4 will shape corporate disclosure on how issuers impact and rely on biodiversity, illuminating the financial risks related to this dependence, and highlighting steps companies can and should take to mitigate their impact on biodiversity loss. Dr. Satyajit Bose, Associate Director of the Climate School&amp;rsquo;s Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management and Professor of Professional Practice at SPS, will interview a panel of ecology, biodiversity, financial, and corporate disclosure experts about the challenges and potential for corporate management of natural capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome Remarks: Dr. Steven Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; is the Director of the Research Program on Sustainability Policy and Management at Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Climate School.

Medicine, Chaplains, and Healing the Whole Person&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The modern world faces religious, spiritual and existential quandaries, as new technologies redefine the beginnings and ends of life. Excruciating choices arise about when to turn off the machines&amp;mdash;whether and when we should &amp;quot;play God.&amp;quot; The COVID-19 pandemic made these dilemmas ever more acute. Increasingly, however, public discourse on religion and spirituality is polarized, with evangelicals on one side and vehement atheists on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book explores how patients and families struggle to make sense of serious disease and threats of death and other medical crises, seeking hope, purpose and larger connections beyond themselves. Physicians and other clinical staff are frequently uncomfortable with these issues, and chaplains have been filling the void, developing valuable approaches and insights. Most Americans will live out their final years in hospitals or nursing homes, and face existential and spiritual quandaries. Many of their prior religious and spiritual beliefs will fall short, and chaplains will often be the ones to assist, partly by reframing narratives and understandings of illness and spirituality. Yet people often know little, if anything, about these professionals. Klitzman presents stories about the spiritual lives of patients and explores the role of chaplains&amp;mdash;who they are, what they do and the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drawing on in-depth interviews and the author&amp;#39;s personal experiences, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor, Will You Pray for Me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides vital information that can assist in medical care decisions. Dr. Klitzman argues that a better understanding of the relationship between these realms will enable more holistic and humane treatment of patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1001512941167?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Klitzman, M.D., Program Director, Bioethics; Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Athina Fontenot (af3018@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

These essential characteristics of intelligent behavior are still beyond the capabilities of today&amp;#39;s most powerful AI architectures, such as Auto-Regressive LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will present a cognitive architecture that may constitute a path towards human-level AI. The centerpiece of the architecture is a predictive world model that allows the system to predict the consequences of its actions. and to plan sequences of actions that that fulfill a set of objectives. The objectives may include guardrails that guarantee the system&amp;#39;s controllability and safety. The world model employs a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) trained with self-supervised learning, largely by observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The JEPA simultaneously learns an encoder, that extracts maximally-informative representations of the percepts, and a predictor that predicts the representation of the next percept from the representation of the current percept and an optional action variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We show that JEPAs trained on images and videos produce good representations for image and video understanding. We show that they can detect unphysical events in videos. Finally, we show that planning can be performed by searching for action sequences that produce predicted end state that match a given target state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTINGUISHED LECTURER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yann LeCun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;VP &amp;amp; Chief AI Scientist, Meta;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor, NYU; ACM Turing Award Laureate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yann LeCun is VP &amp;amp; Chief AI Scientist at Meta and a Professor at NYU.

Selective leg joint control is the ability to move the leg joints in isolation and is mediated by the corticospinal tracts. Dr. Sargent will discuss the developmental trajectory of selective leg joint control in infants with spastic cerebral palsy to inform its use as an early biomarker of spastic cerebral palsy. In addition, she will discuss early activities that can be used to promote selective motor control during infancy, when selective leg joint control is emerging in typical development and when there is the greatest potential for neuroplastic change to maximize lifelong motor function.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Barbara Sargent, PhD, PT is an associate professor of clinical physical therapy.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This LC will meet in person&amp;nbsp;and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 1&amp;nbsp;on Friday 10/11, 1:10pm&amp;ndash;2:25pm, is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb70-9192dd15-0191-95451d09-000050d8events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

We will explore questions such as, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Do plate-scale processes impact island arc exhumation&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How does a continent break up and seafloor spreading start when there is barely any magmatism?; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we know the total offset on a strike-slip boundary?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Emily H.

Instead, Weaver promotes interpolation as the signature form of medieval British historiography and a vehicle of historical theory, arguing that some of the most novel concepts of time in medieval historiography can be found in these altered narratives of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Weaver, historiographical interpolation constitutes the traces of active experimentation with how best to write history, particularly the history of Britain. Historians in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Britain recognized the difficulty of enfolding complex events into a linear chronology and embraced innovative textual methods of creating history. Focusing on the Brut tradition but also analyzing the long history of interpolated historiography, including the Bayeux Embroidery,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Histories&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;offers a new interpretation of generic remixing in medieval writing about the past. Drawing on both manuscript studies and the new formalism, it shows that the practice of inserting materials from romance and hagiography allowed creative revisers to explore how lived events relate to passing time. By embracing interpolation, Weaver provides lively insights into the ways that time becomes history and human actors experience time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/hannah-m-weaver\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hannah Weaver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. She teaches and writes about the literature of medieval Europe, particularly the regions now known as England and France. Her first monograph,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Histories: Interpolation and the Medieval British Past&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(Cornell, 2024), argues that interpolation is the signature form of medieval British historiography and a vehicle of historical theory. Her articles about everything from time in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the treachery of incomprehensible English to the relationship of genre to purgatory have appeared or are forthcoming in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ELH, New Literary History, New Medieval Literatures, JMEMS&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Viator&lt;/em&gt;, among other venues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CU/BC ID holders, register below.

She is a Professor at Columbia GSAPP and Director of the Urban Design Program, where she coordinates complex interdisciplinary studios centered on urban systems of the future. Her design studios and seminars aim to discover new ways of integrating social life, infrastructure, urban form, biodiversity and community-based change. She was awarded a 2017 MacArthur Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Orff is a registered landscape architect and the founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.scapestudio.com/\"&gt;SCAPE&lt;/a&gt;, an award winning 70-person professional practice based in lower Manhattan, where she directs the design of all projects. The firm has won National and local American Society of Landscape Architecture Awards for built projects, planning and communications work, and the work of the office has been featured on the cover of Landscape Architecture magazine, LA China and Topos, and in The New York Times, New Yorker and Economist, among other publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Professor at Columbia and as a practicing professional, she has advanced concepts of sustainable planning and urban design at multiple scales. Orff recently contributed the essay &amp;ldquo;Mending the Landscape&amp;rdquo; to the publication&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;All We Can Save&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(One World, 2020). Her book and traveling exhibit with Richard Misrach titled&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;PETROCHEMICAL AMERICA&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Aperture Foundation, 2012) draws a cognitive map of climate change causes and effects and anticipates future planning challenges for the American landscape. Featuring photographs by Misrach, the book links the lived experience of communities, degraded extraction landscapes and public health issues in the lower Mississippi to national patterns of resource consumption and global waste. In the New York region, SCAPE&amp;rsquo;s Living Breakwaters project was awarded $60 million in CDBG-DR funding by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as part of the Rebuild by Design Initiative. This joint physical-social project in Raritan Bay helps protect Staten Island from future storms, enhances maritime ecosystems and connects residents and students to the shoreline via the Billion Oysters Project curriculum. This project also won the 2014 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, &amp;ldquo;socially responsible design&amp;rsquo;s highest award.&amp;rdquo; It projects a holistic view of human ecology as a path forward and represents a continuum of work that began with the Jamaica Bay study in 2006 and was visualized in &amp;lsquo;Oyster-tecture&amp;rsquo; as part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rising Currents&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2010) exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and&amp;ndash;after Hurricanes Irene and Sandy&amp;ndash;helped shape the debate on how to adapt and retool urban contexts relative to climate dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kate Orff received an Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, reserved for American artists and design practitioners &amp;ldquo;whose work is characterized by a strong personal direction&amp;rdquo; and was named a 2017 MacArthur Foundation &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; Fellow. She was named a United States Artist Fellow, and an Elle magazine &amp;ldquo;Planet Fixer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event content is equivalent to 1.5 AIA/CES total learning credit.

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;IN-PERSON REGISTRATION IS CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;.

What they rarely consider is that, like that of any other nation, America&amp;rsquo;s DNA differs from that of their country. It may take a lifetime to adjust to the unfamiliar country&amp;rsquo;s culture, mentality, and way of doing many things differently from the way they have known. It is especially true when immigrants come to America from a country based on different principles, in this case, collectivist Russia versus individualist America, with opposing political systems&amp;mdash;the democratic American one and the totalitarian Soviet. A sequel to the author&amp;rsquo;s autobiographical trilogy&amp;mdash;Shush! Growing up Jewish under Stalin, In the Jaws of the Crocodile, and Farewell, Mama Odessa&amp;mdash;this book is part mem&amp;shy;oir and part cultural study about the challenges of immigration and American acculturation. With self-deprecating humor, the author, a former Soviet satirist who was punished for trespassing the boundaries of public criticism, recollects his growing pains as he overcame his indoctrinated upbringing in a totalitarian society to embrace America&amp;rsquo;s defining values.&lt;/p&gt;",

Wealth managers must weigh the pros and cons of specialization while keeping an eye on emerging markets and evolving client needs.

In this talk, I explore the&amp;nbsp;drivers of the retirement boom and its unexpected persistence. In the first part, I present findings covering the initial year of the pandemic. Using large-scale public survey data to explore patterns in employment and retirement transitions among older adults, I find that retirement transitions increased broadly across demographic groups but concentrated at the high and low ends of the earnings distribution. Job characteristics that best predicted increased pandemic retirement transitions were employment in high-contact occupations and part-time work schedules. In the second part of the talk, I zoom out to explore the persistence of the pandemic retirement boom in the years since 2020. Using approaches from machine learning to project counterfactual retirement trends, I provide current estimates for the number of excess retirees in the U.S. population and the demographic breakdown of this group. Finally, I discuss the implications for retirement policy, older adults&amp;#39; welfare, and economic theories about retirement behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Traditionally, they have been analyzed using compartmental models (Bass, SI, ...), which implicitly assume that all the individuals are homogeneous and connected to each other. To relax these assumptions, research has gradually shifted to the more fundamental network models, which are particle models for the stochastic adoption/infection by each individual. In this talk I will present an emerging mathematical theory for the Bass and SI models on networks. I will present analytic tools that enable us to obtain explicit expressions for the&amp;nbsp; expected adoption/infection level on various networks (complete, circular, d-regular, Erdos- Renyi, ...), without employing mean-field type approximations. The main focus of the talk will be&amp;nbsp; on the effect of network structure. For example, which networks yield the slowest and fastest spreading? What is the effect of boundaries? Of heterogeneity among individuals? How does the network structure influence the optimal promotional strategy?&lt;/p&gt;",

As more stakeholders and policy makers look to make decisions based on such data, there is an increasing drive for standardization, automation, harmonization, accountability and compliance.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut the data alone will not solve climate change &amp;ndash; people from all job functions are critical to unlocking the learnings, innovations and opportunities that can rapidly decarbonize our systems and supply chains. Professionals from a variety of job functions, working within all major institutions, are taking the initiatives to transform their businesses, making the case for strategic investments, integrating expectations into purchasing contracts, setting benchmarks for regulatory compliance, and innovating new climate-resilient materials and systems.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nClimate change demands that we drive action at a speed commensurate with the challenges we are rapidly learning to quantify.

Do these questions play out differently in France and the United States and what we learn from these differences?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have invited a panel of leading journalists and thinkers to share their reflections on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louis Dreyfus&lt;/strong&gt; is Managing Director of French media group &lt;em&gt;Le Monde.&lt;/em&gt; A graduate from the HEC Business School and an alumnus of the London School of Economics, Louis Dreyfus is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Group &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, the leading independent French media group with numerous publications such as &lt;a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.lemonde.fr_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=009klHSCxuh5AI1vNQzSO0KGjl4nbi2Q0M1QLJX9BeE&amp;amp;r=UOaT3EI62dDv2Mf-nAtTTR3t3XQsaJ8H6Je3ArrKCqs&amp;amp;m=qgHzTJYFcpt1KuY4AiA-yE_Sqx3LC46-_jfiNAoGlyuwY6ukVgogAMaycrBsscqn&amp;amp;s=AQRy0BR89L3RI-NUXnbVePqM1pu9atDkXMNUekqIneY&amp;amp;e=\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; l&amp;rsquo;Obs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;T&amp;eacute;l&amp;eacute;rama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Courrier International&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La Vie&lt;/em&gt;, le &lt;em&gt;Monde Diplomatique&lt;/em&gt; and several digital pure players such as the French edition of &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;.

Departing from leading theoretical accounts which present the courts and legislature as rivals for constitutional supremacy, Kavanagh argues that protecting rights is a collaborative enterprise between all three branches of government - the Executive, the legislature, and the courts. On a collaborative vision of constitutionalism, protecting rights is neither the solitary task of a Herculean super-judge, nor the dignified pronouncements of an enlightened legislature. Instead, it is a complex, dynamic, and collaborative endeavour, where each branch has a distinct but complementary role to play, whilst engaging with each other in a spirit of comity and mutual respect. Connecting constitutional theory with the practice of protecting rights in a democracy, this book offers an innovative understanding of the separation of powers, grounded in the values and virtues of constitutional collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTLgrads Learning Community - Bridging the Divide: Interdisciplinary Teaching and Its Pedagogical Effects (Session 1) - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;for graduate students&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the effects of &amp;ldquo;disciplining&amp;rdquo; knowledge and how might an interdisciplinary approach to developing syllabi enrich pedagogical practice and student learning in the classroom? This two-part LC will consider these questions and the effect of interdisciplinary teaching more broadly. Among the goals of this LC is to consider the benefits of constructing a unified academy and what effect interdisciplinarity has on our students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Graduate student instructors at Columbia encounter students of every major and academic background, particularly in courses taught as part of the core curriculum and language instruction. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching is a valuable method by which to engage students across academic interests. It also supports students&amp;rsquo; learning across disciplines, highlights&amp;nbsp;how knowledge interconnects between academic departments, and encourages students to pursue their own interdisciplinary approach to learning. This LC is intended for participants from all academic disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and will be co-facilitated by Marissa Swan and Emma Leidy, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Wednesday 10/30, 2:10pm&amp;ndash;3:25pm, is available &lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb7c-91bc1926-0191-bdd6412d-00003ca7events@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Within a few short years, she became famous: she was read and debated from Russia to Prussia, from Switzerland to England, from up north in Sweden to down south in Italy. This was not just remarkable because she was a woman, but because of the substance of her contributions. While the men in her milieu like Voltaire and Kant sought disciples to promote their ideas, Du Ch&amp;acirc;telet promoted intellectual autonomy. She counselled her readers to read the classics, but never to become a follower of another&amp;#39;s ideas. Her proclamation that a true philosopher must remain an independent thinker, rather than a disciple of some supposedly &amp;ldquo;great man&amp;rdquo; like Isaac Newton or Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes, posed a threat to an emerging consensus in the Enlightenment. And that made her dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rew Janiak&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor of Philosophy and co-leader of Project Vox at Duke University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christia Mercer&lt;/strong&gt; is Gustave M.

In an era of conflict, crisis, disinformation and fragmentation, public health is more challenging - and more urgent - than ever. 2024-25&amp;rsquo;s Grand Rounds will look at the role of public health in current affairs, and the way current affairs are impacting public health. Together we&amp;rsquo;ll engage in discussions about today&amp;rsquo;s greatest public health challenges, how to learn across differences, potential compromises and solutions, and apply an interdisciplinary lens to understand how some of the biggest debates of the moment are shaping the sector. From themes like the political determinants of health, understanding the toll of inequality on the health of people, and the health consequences of war and crisis, Grand Rounds will focus on threats to public health today as well as what we need to address them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nGrand Rounds was initiated in 2008 at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health to create an intellectual space within which to explore national and global public health challenges and the innovative approaches needed to transform the public&amp;rsquo;s health in the 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We value inclusion and access for all participants and are pleased to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

Following the hard-won recognitions of gay and lesbian victims of the Holocaust and in the maelstrom of contemporary global attacks on trans existence, scholarly and public investments in this history are at their apex&amp;mdash;provoking debates in the German Bundestag and libel cases. Yet the content of this history remains largely unknown. Using granular archival research, Zavier Nunn&amp;rsquo;s first book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trans Liminality and the Paranoid Past: Subjectivity and the State, Germany 1919-45&lt;/em&gt;, explores the micro and macro registers of how everyday trans life was experienced, policed, and cut short across the Weimar and Nazi regimes, sometimes in surprising&amp;mdash;but always uneven&amp;mdash;ways.

How, then, are leaders able to wage war in the face of popular opposition, or end conflicts when the public still supports them? This question is all the more salient as voters wrestle with U.S. support for conflicts abroad and prepare for the 2024 presidential election.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nElizabeth Saunders will help answer key questions surrounding the politics of war, sharing insights from her book &lt;em&gt;The Insiders&amp;rsquo; Game: How Elites Make War and Peace&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(linked &lt;a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691215815/the-insiders-game?srsltid=AfmBOoqEAQwXR6GP7SQp2uPCVpIw8z-9a-Qlw_9rWuQi6jWxRwMHX2XV\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

    "description": "The Light of Learning: Hasidism in Poland on the Eve of the HolocaustRobert Seltzer Lecture Series\nThe Light of Learning: Hasidism in Poland on the Eve of the Holocaust\nThe Light of Learning, by Glenn Dynner, tells the story of an unexpected Hasidic revival in Poland on the eve of the Holocaust. Hasidic leaders reinvented themselves through an ensuing pedagogical revolution. Hasidic yeshivas soon overshadowed courts and Hasidic leaders became known more for scholarship than miracle-working. By mobilizing Torah study, Hasidic leaders were able to subvert the \"civilizing\" projects of the Polish state, successfully rival Zionists and Socialists, and create clandestine yeshiva bunkers in ghettos during the Holocaust. Torah study was thus not only a spiritual-intellectual endeavor but a political practice that fueled a culture of resistance.\u00a0The Light of Learning\u00a0belies notions of late Hasidic decadence and decline and transforms our understanding of Polish Jewry during its final hour.\nPresented by: Dr. Glenn Dynner,\u00a0Carl and Dorothy Bennett Professor of Judaic Studies at Fairfield University, editor of the journal\u00a0Shofar: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies,\u00a0and a recent Guggenheim Fellow.\u00a0He is the author of\u00a0Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society\u00a0(OUP, 2006), and\u00a0Yankel's Tavern: Jews, Liquor, and Life in the Kingdom of Poland\u00a0(OUP, 2013).\u00a0\nThis lecture will be held online via Zoom.\u00a0\n\nZoom link will be provided upon\u00a0RSVP\nPlease download the Zoom app before joining the event\nAccess Hunter College's \"Zoom Webinars Best Practices\" Guide\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 8, 2024\nTime:\n2:30 PM \u2014 3:30 PM\nCollege:\nHunter College\nAddress:\nOnline\nPhone:\n212-772-4000\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://hunter.cuny.edu/event/the-light-of-learning-hasidism-in-poland-on-the-eve-of-the-holocaust/",

    "description": "Create a Unique Degree in CUNY With CUNY BA \u2013 Info SessionWHAT IS CUNY BACCALAUREATE (CUNY BA)?\nCUNY BA is an Interdisciplinary Studies program that works\u00a0within\u00a0the CUNY college system. It has been around for over\u00a0fifty years! CUNY BA is for students who want to design a bachelor\u2019s degree (Area of Concentration|AOC) that is not already offered in CUNY.\nWhile CUNY BA does guide students with requirements, the program does not tell students what to study. Students should know what areas they want to pursue. As part of the CUNY BA application,\u00a0students propose what they want to study\u00a0and what CUNY courses they think are suitable for the bachelor\u2019s degree they are creating (it\u2019s a first draft).\nCUNY BA students take courses in the CUNY departments and/or colleges to fulfill the AOC requirements. So, students will have to be enrolled in a CUNY college to be part of CUNY BA program (that will be the student\u2019s home college).\u00a0\u00a0Students will need to be accepted into a CUNY college for the\u00a0Spring 2025\u00a0semester.\nFor Example:\u00a0A student in CUNYBA would\u00a0not\u00a0create\u00a0an\u00a0Area of Concentration (AOC)\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0just\u00a0\"Computer Science\"\u00a0(since Computer Science is already offered as a traditional\u00a0major\u00a0in a CUNY college). Instead, they would\u00a0create a single AOC\u00a0named\u00a0\"Computer Science and\u00a0Cyber\u00a0Security\" or study two\u00a0disciplines separately and have two AOCs such as\nAOC\u00a01: Computer Science and\u00a0AOC\u00a02:\u00a0Cyber Security and Mathematics.\nThe student searches the CUNY catalogs for courses that are suitable for their Area of Concentration (AOC).\u00a0The courses listed in the AOC must be from\u00a0CUNY\u2019s four-year colleges\u00a0(not community colleges).\nThe CUNY BA info session discusses:\n\nHow CUNY BA works and the application criteria\nThe CUNY BA application process and requirements for creating the CUNY BA Area of Concentration (AOC).\nWhat a CUNY BA Faculty Mentor is\nWhere to search for CUNY courses for your CUNY BA Area of Concentration (AOC).\nOpportunities and pipeline programs within CUNY BA\nQuestion and Answer session\n\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 8, 2024\nTime:\n3:00 PM \u2014 4:00 PM\nCollege:\nCUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies\nAddress:\nONLINE\nPhone:\n2128178220\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://cunyba.cuny.edu/prospective-students/informationsessions/",

This period saw the return of location filming to the city and the reconceptualization of dirt as grit. Over the course of the fall, we will watch and discuss six films that exemplify six different ways in which these images have transformed our understanding of New York City.\u00a0\u00a0***All screenings are on Fridays at 7pm***- September 13 - Voyeur NYC: Rear Window (dir.

    "description": "The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict has provoked many emotions (rage, guilt, victimization, condemnation), and a sense of hopelessness for its resolution. It is important to understand that the tragic events of the past year have occurred in the context of an intractable conflict. Intractable conflicts are characterized by master narratives that explain and justify the conflict for both sides. They support the necessity of the conflict as a zero-sum game. They also demonize the enemy and provide the set of arguments that is often associated with religious and moral superiority.This series is faculty-led and will explore the current Israel/Palestine conflict through the dynamics of intractability which includes psychological, historical and political components. We will hear the voices of both Israelis and Palestinian experts on the conflict, psychologists who study the relational effects of these master narratives, and hear from activists, local and international ones, who propose alternatives in this dismal landscape. These events are also organized to fulfill the mission of a University meant to prepare students through education, knowledge, and dialogue.  The seminars is collated by faculty members Warren Spielberg (NSPE) and Benoit Challand (NSSR).\u00a0Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

    "title": "2025 Management and Social Justice Conference Submission Call",
    "description": "We are pleased to invite scholars, educators, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and students to submit abstracts of papers, proposals for workshops and panel discussions to participate in the 2025 Management and Social Justice Conference to be held in New York.\u00a0Background:From May 2020, the Management and Social Justice collective has examined the peculiar and paradoxical challenge that haunts the field of management studies. On one hand, management is frequently demonized as a realm of oppressive ideas and practices on how to impoverish the world further by focusing on extractive economies that depend on endless growth. On the other, there is widespread agreement on the necessity for such ideas to make the world we inhabit a slightly better place and even use management theory and practice for collective advancement. Together, we have examined, debated, embraced, and critiqued these ideas and practices over the last four years in virtual conversations and in the 2023 conference held in New York City.\u00a0 Please visit our website for more information on the work done so far in virtual formats. For more information on the 2023 conference, visit, our conference website.\u00a0The Call:The continuing animating question is if it is possible think of management in terms of larger questions of social justice and use management ideas and practices to generate social justice (whether ecological, economic, racial, sexual, or gender). For the 2025 conference, we are focusing on the role of technology in shaping managing for social justice. Technology has a significant impact on how management thoughts evolve (Bodrozic & Adler, 2017; Bodrozic & Alder, 2022; Akhil, S.G. & Poonamallee, L. 2023). The role of technology innovation for solving social and environmental problems is well-established (Poonamallee, et.al. 2021; Scillitoe, et.al. 2019; Joy, et.al. 2022).\u00a0 However, it is a complicated space with contradictory beliefs and evidence. While technology has made workplace flexibility possible through remote work practices, it has given rise to surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2018). While technology innovation has led to an empowered civil society and citizen science applications, it has also led to organizations like Cambridge Analytica, psychological profiling of voters and targered misinformation and disinformation campaigns challenging the very foundations of democracy. Technology has bridged access and resource gaps in education and global health while also simultaneously deepening wealth gaps and data ownership and particularly the vulnerable and lower socioeconomic classes are subject to even more disempowerment. Open source, distributed, and collectively and cooperatively owned technologies are increasingly popular, wealthiest men on the planet who own close to half of the planet\u2019s wealth are all connected with technology as business. We hope to explore some of these issues in this conference in a critical, collaborative, and constructive fashion and continue to strengthen this community of inquiry and practice.We encourage submissions from a diverse array of fields and not just what one sees as traditional management, i.e. folks who work in business schools or work in businesses or occupy the role of managers or entrepreneurs. We welcome contributions from different disciplines including humanities and arts, different industries, different occupations, different vantage points, and different perspectives. Please see Annexure 1 at the end of this call for a list of potential (not exhaustive topics and questions).Full papers are not necessary for inclusion in this conference. Full papers if submitted however will be fast-tracked for review in an edited volume currently under consideration with Palgrave Macmillan/Springer, who published previous edited volumes Socio-Tech Innovation: Harnessing Technology Innovation for Social Good (2020) and Managing for Social Justice: Harnessing Management Theory and Practice for Collective Good (2023).Submission Information:All submissions must be at least 750 words and not more than 1500 words. We invite the following types of submissions:\u00a0- Scholarly submissions (750-1500 words): We will organize both traditional paper presentations and poster sessions.\u00a0- Proposals for Teaching Demos/Workshops Must have details about the workshop or demo design; must have an experiential component.\u00a0- Practice panels (minimum 1500 words). Practice panels should introduce the topic and list panelists who have agreed to participate and attend the conference and their expertise.\u00a0\u00a0We encourage all proposals to consider the implications for teaching and practice.\u00a0Please include a separate title page with names, affiliations, and email contact for all the submitters.Submit to poonamallee@newschool.edu\u00a0with the subject line Management and Social Justice Conference Submission.\u00a0Important Dates:Deadline for submission of abstracts: Nov 1, 2024Acceptance Notification: Dec 15, 2025Conference Early Bird registration: Feb 5, 2025Conference dates: March 6-8, 2025Email poonamallee@newschool.edu with questions.",

The panel is part of a series of public events coinciding\u00a0 with our current exhibition, Regeneration of Flax: Linseed, Linen, Shive & Oil at the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, 66 Fifth Avenue at 13th Street, New York.\u00a0With 60% of textile fibers made of synthetic polyester today, we look to the robust history of flax growing over the last 36,000 years, as a viable biobased alternative to synthetics.\u00a0 Flax is grown as a rotational crop and sequesters carbon as it grows. Flax fibers create linen fabrics, composites and insulation. Flax seed can be a food, or pressed into oils for finishes and flooring. Shive, a woody byproduct, is used for mulch and being researched for flaxlime.\u00a0 We will discuss the methods of farming organically and the potential of flax to remove heavy metals from soil. Experts will discuss the challenges of scaling, applications in the built environment\u00a0 and the benefits of local material sourcing for regional economies.\u00a0\u00a0What if designers were more connected with agriculture and the lifecycle of their materials?\u00a0The panel will be held from 5-6:30pm.\u00a0 The exhibition opening and reception 6:30-8pm.\u00a0RSVP Today!",

    "description": "Mark Setterfield, Leo Model Professor of Economics at NSSR&lt;\u00a0will present his latest paper, \"Integrating the Social Reproduction of Labor into Macroeconomic Theory.\"Abstract:The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the integration of unpaid care-giving in the household into short- and long-term macroeconomic theory and, in particular, the theoretical structure of production on the supply-side of the economy. The ambition of the project is to furnish a general theoretical representation of how unpaid care giving and its (gendered) social structure contributes to the technical conditions of production in the sphere of marketed output. In so doing, it aims to provide macro theorists with an apparatus that allows consistent description of both short-term (levels of activity) and long-term (rates of growth) macro outcomes in a manner that routinely integrates feminist insights regarding the gendered structure of the social reproduction of labor into macroeconomic analysis.Non-New School community members: Please register to get access to the buildings, as those that don't and are not on the RSVP list may be refused by security.",

Can the success of a radical protest movement offer a path through the climate crisis?\u00a0Filmmakers Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau will discuss their new film.

    "description": "Course will be conducted in Chinese. Chinese description follows English description below.This free 10-week online seminar offers a series of timely debates conducted in Chinese and aimed at a global Chinese audience, focusing on important and controversial issues in Chinese politics and international relations that cannot be freely discussed inside China. In each 90-minute session, guest debaters who are authorities in the subject area will be randomly assigned to present pro and con positions on the following propositions; the audience will vote on each proposition before the debate and at the end of the debate, and will also have a chance to pose questions.\u00a0We hope to help Chinese in China and around the world think through their own positions on a variety of issues facing China at home and abroad.Debate topics include:\u00a01. Democracy is suitable for China2. The China Model works well; it should be emulated by other countries3. The majority of Chinese people support the Chinese Communist Party4. China\u2019s long-term strategic goal is to overthrow the rule-based international order5. The West\u2019s engagement policy toward China was a failure6. The way modern technology is developing helps drive the trend toward authoritarianism7. It is not enough for the U.S. to manage competition with China, it needs to promote regime change8. Activists can effectively promote China\u2019s democratization through non-violent means9. Chinese people should support \u201cthe great unification\u201d\u00a0\u00a010.

    "description": "This symposium Chile's Design Stories: A Sociopolitical Journey to Modernity\u00a0(organized by Chile's Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage in collaboration with the School of Art & Design History & Theory) brings together diverse perspectives to offer a historical overview of Chile\u2019s cultural legacy and its connection to Latin American modernity. These reflections are centered on Chilean works featured in the exhibition Crafting Modernity: Design in Latin America, 1940\u20131980, currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art.Drawing from this collection of objects, authors, processes, and materials\u2014as well as their political and intellectual contexts\u2014the presentations will unveil a series of critical narratives about the relationship between design and modernity in Chile. These discussions will lay the groundwork for exploring methodologies to construct design histories through an analytical and contextualized lens.The symposium will feature presentations by design scholars Igor Fracalossi (Universidad Finis Terrae), Rita Hurtado (Universidad de Santiago), Fernando Portal (Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas), Tamara Poblete (University of Amsterdam), and Rodrigo Vera (Universidad de Chile).",

    "title": "Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico Book Launch",
    "description": "Book launch of Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico, including panel discussion and reception.The Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico documents and analyzes the diversity of collective memory projects throughout Mexico since the start of the \u201cwar against drug cartels\u201d, in a context of various intersecting and ongoing forms of violence. There are now\u00a0more than 110,000 victims of enforced disappearance and the numbers grow every month. Memorialization has been acknowledged as an important tool in the context of mass human rights violations and is often seen as a symbolic form of reparation for the victims, predominantly after regime change or a clearly-defined end to large scale violence. Compared to other cases in Latin America and other parts of the world, this has not been the case in Mexico. The scholars, activists, families of victims, architects and artists that write in this book address the pressing questions that emerge from the particularity of the Mexican case: Why would activists use the language and aesthetics of commemoration in the midst of ongoing violence and human rights abuses? What is the function of commemoration in the absence of peace and justice? What does it mean to commemorate in the absence of evidence and in the absence of bodies (i.e. in the case of the disappeared)?The Struggles for Memory examines historical connections across mobilizations around collective memory in Mexico in the context of the dirty war of the 1960s and 1970s and recent events from the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa in 2014, to the women who search for mass graves around the country, among a number of other memorialization efforts around the country, some well-known and others not so widely disseminated. The book challenges the framing of the violence merely as an issue related to drugs and organized crime. These interventions show the continuities in state violence over time, drawing attention to forms of structural violence that cut across enforced disappearances, violence against women, migrant deaths, resource extraction, attacks on activists and journalists, and the enduring discrimination against indigenous peoples and the dispossession of their lands.

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Klaus Vieweg, \"Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics of Painting\"",
    "description": "Abstract: What connects Hegel with Rembrandt? What are the important points of contact between the grand master of modern philosophizing and the virtuosos of Dutch painting? Why does Hegel, as an outstanding representative of the school of German Idealism, the golden age of modern philosophy, recognize in the paintings of Rembrandt and the Dutch school of the Golden Age a greatness of spirit and freedom, a revolution in painting, the modernity of this art of painting? Why is Hegel fascinated by such pictures of proud citizens, vegetable and herring sellers, street urchins, the poor and beggars, landscapes and Dutch mills, farmers at harvest and in the inn, women playing the piano, canals with skaters, bouquets of flowers and breakfast tables - depictions of seemingly banal scenes of everyday life?By laying the foundations for a modern aesthetic theory in his lectures on the philosophy of art, Hegel provides decisive arguments against classicist and romanticist devaluations of Dutch Golden Age painting. Against the glorification of antiquity (classicism) and the Christian Middle Ages (late romanticism), his philosophy of art brought about a paradigm shift towards the art of modernity as free art, an art of free spirituality - \"only in its freedom is beautiful art true art\". Hegel can be regarded as the founder of a modern aesthetic of painting in the sense of combining philosophy and art history.Bio: Klaus Vieweg is Professor of Classical German Philosophy at the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena and one of the world's leading Hegel experts. Vieweg has authored or edited over two dozen books, including Hegel. Der Philosophie der Freiheit (Munich: 2019) translated into English as Hegel: The Philosopher of Freedom (Stanford 2023).",

    "description": "*Please plan ahead and arrive 15 minutes prior to the event. Due to demand, tickets not processed by event start will be released. Thank you!The Westerlies: Wherein Lies The Good\u00a0The origins of The Westerlies go back to the high school bandrooms of Seattle, Washington, where the four original members first met and came of age together. In this program, the ensemble returns to their roots to celebrate music from their hometown, including Wherein Lies the Good, an expansive work by Robin Holcomb originally written for solo piano, as well as works by her contemporaries Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, and Ron Miles.\u00a0Repertoire to include:Wherein Lies the Good \u2014 Robin HolcombSweeter Than The Day \u2014 Wayne HorvitzCupid \u2014 Ron MilesMonroe \u2014 Bill Frisell\u00a0All arrangements by The Westerlies.The Westerlies are the Ensemble-in-Residence at the\u00a0School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School College of Performing Arts\u00a0\u00a0Free with registration / Space is Limited!\u00a0The Westerlies:The Westerlies, \u201can arty quartet\u2026mixing ideas from jazz, new classical, and Appalachian folk\u201d (New York Times) are a New York-based brass quartet comprised of Riley Mulherkar and Chloe Rowlands on trumpet, and Andy Clausen and Addison Maye-Saxon on trombone. From Carnegie Hall to Coachella, The Westerlies navigate a wide array of venues and projects with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family sing-along.Formed in 2011, the self-described \u201caccidental brass quartet\u201d takes its name from the prevailing winds that travel from the West to the East. \u201cSkilled interpreters who are also adept improvisers\u201d (NPR\u2019s Fresh Air), The Westerlies explore jazz, roots, and chamber music influences to create the rarest of hybrids: music that is both \"folk-like and composerly, lovely and intellectually rigorous\u201d (NPR Music).The ensemble has produced numerous critically acclaimed albums of genre-defying music. 2022 saw the release of the Songbook Vol. 2 and Live at TOURISTS on Westerlies Records, the ensemble\u2019s in-house record label. The previous year was a prolific year for the ensemble, with the release of Fireside Brass: A Westerlies Holiday (Westerlies Records), Songbook Vol. 1 (Westerlies Records), and Bricolage (Westerlies Records), a collaborative album of improvisations with pianist/composer Conrad Tao. 2021 also saw the release of This Land, the ensemble\u2019s collaboration with GRAMMY-nominated vocalist Theo Bleckmann. Sought-after collaborators, The Westerlies are also featured on recordings by Fleet Foxes (Nonesuch), Big Red Machine (Jagjaguwar), Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 (Six Degrees Records), Common (Lakeshore) and Dave Douglas (Greenleaf).Education and community engagement are core elements of The Westerlies' mission. In 2021, The Westerlies were named the inaugural small ensemble-in-residence at the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School. The Westerlies also produce an annual music festival in Seattle called Westerlies Fest, which combines evening performances featuring numerous guest artists, an all-day open-to-the-public creative music jamboree, and workshops in local public schools. The Westerlies have engaged students of all ages and abilities around the country with their innovative assemblies and masterclasses, promoting the values of cooperation and inclusion through music.This performance will be LIVESTREAMED.

If we are smart, we listen, we follow these murmurs and we see where they lead.\u00a0 Jon-Sesrie Goff does just that in After Sherman. His florid documentary eavesdrops on fragmented dialogues: between father and son, among friends and neighbors, between land and river and, of course, between the past and the present. These conversations are ambitiously framed by the director, in his notes, as meditations on inheritance and our nation\u2019s twisted history. And while After Sherman fulfills that mission, it\u2019s most captivating when it burrows into Goff\u2019s personal history, recording the stories and rituals of his Gullah Geechee community\u201d \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarke",

    "title": "Heuss Lecture | Christina Morina, \"A Thousand New Beginnings: Germans\u00a0and Their Democracy since the 1980s\"",
    "description": "\u00a0What motivates the federal republic? Nearly 75 years since its creation and more than thirty since reunification, German democracy is under pressure: political extremism is spreading, the major political parties are battling vanishing approval ratings, and resentment and anti-democratic feelings are on the rise. How did we get here?Renowned historian Christina Morina believes that to understand modern German history, we need to stop thinking of it as a straightforward story of democracy and dictatorship. In her new book,\u00a0Tausend Aufbr\u00fcche (A Thousand New Beginnings, English edition in preparation for 2025), she examines countless letters to politicians, petitions, leaflets and other documents to show how citizenship and democracy have meant different things to different people over the past 40 years. For the first time, this\u00a0political-cultural history of modern Germany looks at the 1989 revolution in light of the history of German democracy \u2013 revealing the diverse and stubborn ways in which Germans from all walks of life, east and west, have approached democracy in theory and in practice, how their ideas are shaping the so-called Berlin Republic, and the associated opportunities and dangers.Christina Morina is the 2024-2025 Visiting Heuss Professor in History at The New School for Social Research. She is Professor of General History with a particular focus on Contemporary History at the University of Bielefeld. Her research focuses on major themes in German and European history from the in 19th to the 21st century, particularly Nazism and the history of bystanding during the Holocaust; socialism, Marxism and communism; political and memory culture(s) in Germany since 1945, as well as the history of historiography.This annual Heuss Lecture is part of The New School for Social Research's General Seminar event series.

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

    "description": "In China, recent reforms have aimed at expanding social security coverage, improving healthcare, and addressing rural-urban disparities. India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance. ",

    "description": "Golem is the first full-length play written by Dylan Gottlieb after graduating from The New School's Dramatic Arts BFA in May 2021. This play is three acts with two intermissions.Golem offers a brief, ultimately insufficient glimpse of a world that has long since passed from the earth: that of Yiddish-speaking Eastern Europeans. This world was vibrant, culturally diverse, split between disparate political regimes, forming and shifting over centuries of migration, economic development, and change. By the end of the 19th century, democratic revolutions in Western Europe had long since ended anti-Semitic legal restrictions dating from the Medieval Era, allowing for the gradual integration of Jews into the broader society. But in Eastern Europe's autocratic and multinational empires, these restrictions persisted for longer. In 1900 the Russian Empire boasted the largest population of Jews of any state on earth, subjected to a distinctly anti-Semetic and repressive legal system within a territory known as the \"Pale of Settlement\" - the singular region of the Empire in which Jews were permitted to live, spanning parts of modern Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states.",

    "title": "Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Domingues | Liberalism & Republicanism: From Expansion to Retraction",
    "description": "Political modernity set off, through liberalism and a modern form of republicanism, programmatically and historically, with a rather oligarchical and abstract perspective. Accordingly, most citizens \u2013 if they were citizens at all \u2013 did not participate, at least fully, in the political system and had only civil rights \u2013 limited in particular for women but also for specific groups of the population, foremostly slaves. Abstractness hid however these concrete issues, besetting workers and the popular classes in general, as well as women, also in their plebeian political being. Abstractness implied also the personalization and personification of politics should be strictly limited. Through social and political struggles concreteness penetrated however the structure of the state, democratizing the political system of liberal republicanism, broadening political rights, and introducing social policies and rights, tending often to universalization. Highly oligarchical mass organizations \u2013 parties, unions, associations, churches \u2013 were crucial for this expansive moment. This movement has been reversed since the 1970s, implying a moment of retraction of republican liberalism towards a sort of de-democratized advanced oligarchical political system, despite the formal trappings of democracy, and the restriction of social policies, concentrated on the poor rather them aiming at the citizen. Concreteness has not disappeared, though, with society cut out in different groups and the personalization and personification of politics (so-called \u201cpopulism\u201d). This movement is internal rather than inimical to liberalism. At the same time, the \u201creal socialist\u201d (authoritarian collectivism) failed and returned to capitalism, although keeping the party-state form. It does not appear any longer as an alternative at all. The question that remains is whether republican liberalism can resume its expansive movement or whether, as authoritarian collectivism, it is exhausted in its creative capacities and historical dynamics and in terms of propelling social forces.",

    "title": "Pleistocene Park: Engineering Wilderness in a More-than-Human World",
    "description": "Pleistocene Park is a large-scale science experiment in Arctic Siberia in the form of a future-oriented rewilding project with the goal of mitigating climate change. The Park\u2019s creators hypothesize that introducing large herbivores into the area will slow the thawing of permafrost. Using the approach of multispecies ethnography, in attending to the nonhuman agencies at work in the project, Anya Bernstein (Harvard) argues that the Park differs from other rewilding projects, which are usually ecocentric, in emerging as a survivalist project with a distinct anthropocentric bent. Even so, however, the Park\u2019s survivalist goal for humans coexists with ontologies based on collaboration and mutual aid between humans and nonhumans, and between organic and inorganic matter, with extensive agency assigned to nonhuman others. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork within the frame of the Park\u2019s various genealogies, she traces the project\u2019s underlying assumptions in equal measure to the history of Russian science and to the experience of the Park\u2019s lead scientists of sociopolitical rupture following the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a case study, Pleistocene Park is especially suited to exploring issues of time and temporality, apocalypticism and redemption, extinction and eternity, in addition to particular visions of the natural and the human.",

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Mohamed Amer Meziane, \"Of Subterranean\u00a0Imperiality:\u00a0Heaven, Earth, and the Accumulation of Capital\"",
    "description": "How is the State involved in the climate crisis?\u00a0Drawing on\u00a0The States of the Earth\u00a0(Verso, 2024), Mohamed Amer Meziane (Brown University) will attempt to develop a theory of what he calls the Fossil State, partly based on a critical dialogue with Marxism\u00a0that differs from most eco-socialist perspectives. He will suggest that the concept of\u00a0imperiality (not coloniality) might help us analyze the theologico-political knot underpinning the modern capitalist State in both its religious and secular forms. Because the State never exists as an isolated entity but as part of a system of interconnected states, I will turn to inter-imperiality to describe aspects of the geopolitics of climate beyond the opposition between war and peace. By reinterpreting \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d in terms not only of State/colonial violence but of imperial secularization (not secularism), he thus wants to contribute to a different understanding of the entanglements of colonialism and capital and to try and find overlaps between eco-Marxist and anti-colonial approaches.Bio:\u00a0Mohamed Amer Meziane holds a PhD in Philosophy and Intellectual History from the University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. After teaching at Columbia University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life, he joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor of Francophone Humanities and Middle East Studies affiliated with the Watson Institute. He is the author of The States of the Earth: An Ecological and Racial History of Secularization. The book won the Albertine Prize for non-fiction in 2023 and was published in English in April 2024 by Verso Books. His second book was published in French in 2023. It is titled: Au bord des mondes. Vers une anthropologie m\u00e9taphysique (At the Edge of the Worlds: Towards a Metaphysical Anthropology).\u00a0His books have been reviewed in several media such as Le Monde, Mediapart and The Los Angeles Review Books. He is also invited to write texts about several contemporary artists for exhibitions catalogs, art galleries or journals such as Flash Art. ",

VLC Borderlands Curatorial Fellow Larissa Nez (Din\u00e9) introduces and moderates the conversation to ask: How can artists and historians correct or produce a \u201ccorrect\u201d record of Indigenous histories?

Does international law no longer matter in Hong Kong? &lt;a href=\"https://law.hawaii.edu/people/petersen/\"&gt;Carole Petersen&lt;/a&gt;, professor of law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, finds that in cases not affecting Beijing&amp;rsquo;s core interests, local judges still rely on international and comparative sources and still rule against the local Hong Kong government. This has been particularly evident in strategic litigation to advance the rights of the LGBT community. Petersen concludes that if the local government is serious about trying to rebuild Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s international reputation, then it should accept and fully implement these rulings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the significance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, I argue that it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. In this talk, I present our OLMo project aimed at building strong language models and making them fully accessible to researchers along with open-source code for data, training, and inference. I describe our efforts in building language modeling from scratch, expanding their scope to make them applicable and useful for real-world applications, and investigating a new generation of LMs that address fundamental challenges inherent in current models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;\nHanna Hajishirzi is the Torode Family Associate Professor in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a Senior Director of NLP at AI2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Her current research delves into various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular emphasis on accelerating the science of language modeling, broadening their scope, and enhancing their applicability and usefulness for human lives. She has published over 140 scientific articles in prestigious journals and conferences across ML, AI, NLP, and Computer Vision. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Intel Rising Star Award, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, Academic Achievement UIUC Alumni Award, and Innovator of the Year Award by GeekWire. The work from her lab has been nominated for or has received best paper awards at various conferences and has been featured in numerous magazines and newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;",

They are eager to learn local languages. Immigration is not a burden on social services. Border walls do not work. There is no unmanageable refugee crisis. Yet many such misinformed assumptions and harmful misconceptions pervade conversations about immigration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a timely, practical, and evidence-based discussion on immigrants and immigration. Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione debunk frequently encountered claims and answer common questions. Invoking the latest findings and decades of interdisciplinary research and considering a wide range of places, ethnic groups, and historical eras, Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione provide the key data and context to understand how immigration affects economies, crime rates, and social welfare systems, and shed light on contentious issues such as the safety of the U.S.-Mexico border and the consequences of Brexit. This conversation aims to be a guide for those who want to counter false claims about immigration and are interested in what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time will be allocated for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Casta&amp;ntilde;eda and Cione have produced a powerfully-written and persuasive statement against several of the most common stereotypes about contemporary immigration.

As the South Asian subcontinent was partitioned in 1947 to gain freedom from Britain&amp;#39;s colonial hold, and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was formed, the city&amp;#39;s large Hindu and Sikh populations were pushed toward India, and an even larger Muslim refugee population settled in the city. This was just the latest in a long history of the city&amp;#39;s making and unmaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, the city has kept a firm grip on the imagination of travelers, poets, writers, and artists. More recently, it has been journalists who have been drawn to the city as a focal point for a nation that continues to grab international headlines. For this book, acclaimed historian Manan Ahmed Asif brings to life a diverse and vibrant world by walking the city again and again over the course of many years. Along the way he joins Sufi study circles and architects doing restoration in the medieval parts of Lahore and speaks with a broad range of storytellers and historians. To this Asif juxtaposes deep analysis of the city&amp;#39;s centuries-old literary culture, noting how it reverberates among the people of Lahore today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To understand modern Pakistan requires understanding its cultural capital, and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Disrupted City&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;uses Lahore&amp;#39;s cosmopolitan past and its fractured present to provide a critical lens to challenge the grand narratives of the Pakistani nation-state and its national project of writing history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://sofheyman.org/persons/manan-ahmed\"&gt;Manan Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor in the History Department at Columbia, is a historian of South Asia and the littoral western Indian Ocean world from 1000-1800 CE.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Unbound: Expanding American Book History &amp;amp; Textual Objects of Intercultural Encounters, The Columbia University Seminar in Material Texts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unbound&amp;quot; considers the impact on book history of the new collection, &lt;em&gt;American Contact: Objects of Intercultural Encounters and the Boundaries of Book History&lt;/em&gt; (UPenn Press, 2024). In forty-eight short chapters, &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the dynamics of intercultural encounters through the medium of material texts. Each essay focuses on one object to demonstrate how particular ways of reading can render the complex meanings of the objects legible\u2015or explains why and how the meanings remain illegible. In its diversity and breadth, this volume shows how the field of book history can be more inclusive and expansive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium features scholars from multiple disciplines and career stages. Together, across three panels, they will address questions about the role of collaboration in research, the pedagogical uses of &lt;em&gt;American Contact&lt;/em&gt;, and the future of book history. Participants include Ahmed Alami, Rhae Lynn Barnes, Glenda Goodman, David Hall, Joseph Howley, Abimbola Cole Kai-Lewis, Isadora Mota, Shari Rabin, Martin Tsang, and Adrian Weimer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The symposium will be followed by a reception beginning at 4pm in the Rare Book &amp;amp; Manuscript Library on the 6th floor.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Humor is often at the center of complex legal cases and content moderation decisions regarding free speech and its limits. How can judges &amp;ndash; or social media platforms &amp;ndash; navigate the gray areas between satire and defamation, provocative jokes and hate speech, or parody and copyright violation? These challenges have become increasingly daunting in the digital age, with ironic ambiguity and context collapse playing a key role in online communication. Moreover, generative AI (e.g. deepfakes) has further muddled the line between legitimate creative reuse on the one hand (as in parody or satire), and the violation of personal or IP rights on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These issues lie at the center of the forthcoming toolkit&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Joke? Assessing Humor in Free Speech Jurisprudence and Content Moderation&lt;/em&gt;, authored by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alberto Godioli&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Groningen),&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sabine Jacques&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Liverpool),&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ariadna Matamoros Fern&amp;aacute;ndez&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Queensland University of Technology), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Young&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of Groningen) with funding from the Dutch Research Council (&lt;a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/impexp23-24014\"&gt;NWO Impact Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;grant). The toolkit is primarily intended for legal professionals and Trust &amp;amp; Safety agents, with the aim of helping them establish an informed, well-balanced, and consistent approach to humorous expression in light of both human rights law and interdisciplinary humor research. However, it will also be of interest to policymakers and advocacy groups, by addressing topical questions concerning both the protection of lawful humorous expression and the adjudication of illegal or borderline (albeit superficially humorous) content. Lastly, it aims to assist humor creators of all types &amp;ndash; from comedians and cartoonists to &amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; social media users &amp;ndash; in gaining awareness of their rights, while also highlighting the links between certain types of derogatory humor, hate, and harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;October 25, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, the toolkit authors will join us at Columbia University to present an advanced draft of the toolkit and collect feedback before finalizing its publication, which is scheduled for January 2025.

Information technology has become essential for managing the US&amp;#39;s complex elections, and, when all goes well, provides great benefits in efficiency, accuracy, and usability. But computers and software are also notoriously (and fundamentally) unreliable and vulnerable to tampering, and the systems we use for voting and election management are no exception. In some ways, the integrity of election outcomes has become dependent on the integrity of technology that may not always work as intended. Can we trust election outcomes? Should we?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, recent advances have found reliable methods for conducting high-integrity elections even with flawed (or malicious( technology. This talk will examine the technologies used in elections, the ways they can fail, and practical safeguards that mitigate risks they introduce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;\nMatt Blaze, Ph.D., is a professor of law at Georgetown Law and a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. For more than 25 years, Blaze&amp;rsquo;s research and scholarship has focused on security and privacy in computing and communications systems, especially as we rely on insecure platforms such as the internet for increasingly critical applications. His work has focused particularly on the intersection of this technology with public policy issues. For example, in 2007, he led several of the teams that evaluated the security of computerized election systems from several vendors on behalf of the states of California and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;",

Picking up on this theme, this seminar explores the role&lt;br /&gt;\nof central banks in governing finance not only in the midst of financial crises, but also&lt;br /&gt;\ncontinuously as guardians of financial stability. Remarkably, the shadow banking system, which&lt;br /&gt;\nhad largely been viewed as causal for the 2008 crisis, expanded rather than contracting under the&lt;br /&gt;\nwatch of central banks. When faced with new episodes of financial instability, central banks have&lt;br /&gt;\nresponded with more large-scale asset purchases and similar measures to support the financial&lt;br /&gt;\nsystem. This raises the question whether central banks are governing finance, or whether,&lt;br /&gt;\ninstead, finance is forcing central banks to dance to their tune. This is not a new question, and&lt;br /&gt;\nneither is it limited to the US, or even the circle of the C5 (Fed, Bank of England, ECB, Swiss&lt;br /&gt;\nCB, Bank of Japan). By putting the recent episodes of the entanglement of central banks with&lt;br /&gt;\nfinance into historical perspective, we are hoping to shed new light on the forces that shape&lt;br /&gt;\nmoney, banking, and finance more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lev Menand&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia Law School&lt;br /&gt;\nColumbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stefano Ugolini&lt;br /&gt;\nUniversity of Toulouse&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/FVAmbDuqbGfFkZzM6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Link to Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

These processes are pivotal to global water, carbon, and elemental cycles, with far-reaching implications for mantle rheology, climate stability, the origin of life on early Earth, submarine resources, subduction zone dynamics, and geohazards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Controlled-source marine seismic surveys are powerful tools for investigating these processes due to the capacity to generate high-resolution, extensive images of the oceanic lithosphere. However, traditional methods&amp;mdash;such as ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) traveltime tomography and multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection imaging&amp;mdash;often leave resolution gaps at various depths, limiting the quantitative imaging of fluid-related structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on advancing and applying high-resolution full waveform inversion (FWI) techniques in marine seismic studies to bridge these gaps and achieve &amp;lsquo;full-wavelength imaging&amp;rsquo;. In this presentation, I will highlight case studies where FWI of MCS data unveils hydrothermal pathways within the ultramafic Rainbow massif at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These findings, combined with Vp/Vs structures derived from local earthquake tomography, underscore the role of lithological contrasts. Additionally, I will demonstrate how FWI of OBS data helps quantify melt in the lower crust of an ultraslow-spreading ridge segment and elucidates the ocean to-continent transition at a magma-poor rifted margin offshore Nova Scotia. Finally, I will briefly discuss ongoing research projects and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hanchao Jian is a Research Associate at Woods Hole Oceanography Institution (WHOI). He earned his PhD in Marine Geophysics in 2017 through a joint program between Peking University and Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP). Before joinging WHOI, he did postdoctoral research at both IPGP and Dalhousie University. His research focuses on high-resolution imaging of oceanic crustal structure at plate boundaries, with a particular interest in fluid-related processes such as hydrothermal circulation and melt dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom link:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/92780275650?pwd=BgfOzfYBkYE2iTUEKMkE2wJLoDI7Ul.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting ID: 927 8027 5650&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passcode: 582874&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For a complete view of the planned seminars this semester, please visit the calendar on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lamont.columbia.edu/events/geodynamics-seminars\"&gt;Geodynamics Seminar webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Hope for the future, or our undoing? IRCPL&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;American Religion is&amp;hellip;Human&amp;quot; program offers new ways of thinking about AI, humanity, and religion, going past the utopian-dystopian binaries that our public discourse is stuck in. We will think together about how the rise of potentially destabilizing AI technology might intersect productively with current efforts to rethink humanistic pedagogy and scholarship. Join IRCPL as we interrogate assumptions about religion&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;human-ness&amp;rdquo; and considerations of hierarchy and supremacy raised by the notion of religion as an innately human concept.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This series is made possible by generous support from the Henry Luce Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free and open to the public. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registration is required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjVRVfGrOJVBV-oWfBpA5zs4-N3D1bWghhVmtzGnrgHc1chw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Please register in advance to reserve your spot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All prospective attendees must register by 4:00PM on Sunday, October 27th.

By focusing on mass-produced examples of concrete poetry, the publication presents these poetic experiments as organically linked to social movements, critical theories, and youth cultural revolutions. In his presentation, Boynik, will discuss the concrete and visual poetry in socialist Yugoslavia as an uneven and combined development, and emphasize its confrontational and organizational aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Among others the publication includes accounts on the early years of OHO formation and its complex theories of words and things; an interview with Rastko Mo\u010dnik on programmed art and political formalism; militant polemics of Goran Babi\u0107; Signalist contradictions; subjective structural devices of Judita &amp;Scaron;algo; zaum experiments of Vojislav Despotov; detective meta-texts of Slavoj \u017di\u017eek; poetic self-management studies of Vujica Re&amp;scaron;in Tuci\u0107; a feminist historicization of A\u017ein school for experimental poetry; democratization of visual poetry by Westeast; selections from special issues of the journals Pitanja, Problemi, Ulaznica, Dometi, Delo, Koraci, Vidik, Pegaz, and many other materials translated into English for the first time and presented in one publication.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this newest essay, &lt;em&gt;Universaliser: L&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute; par les voies d&amp;rsquo;humanit&amp;eacute;,&lt;/em&gt; he argues that universalism can be conceived as a dialogue among different cultures in a way that recognizes and values these differences as equal contributions to the whole. No region in the world can claim to define universalism and impose its definition on the rest of the world. Thinking about humanity as a whole is infinitely difficult, and it requires a philosophy of de-centering and the elimination of cultural hierarchies to forge together, as equals, a collective conception of the universal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a time when ethnonationalism, tribal identities, and the violent domination of some countries and peoples over others are rising all around us, Souleymane Bachir Diagne retains his faith in humanity and defends universalism as a collective project for all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Souleymane Bachir Diagne&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor Philosophy and French at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Mame-Fatou Niang&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French Studies, the Founder | Director of the Center for Black European Studies at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Dodman&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French and Director of the History and Literature Program at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As that development has led to at times heated debates among historians and social scientists, the first lecture will analyze the most important controversies from 1950 to the present, to provide the larger historical context. The second lecture will present the latest scholarship on Germany&amp;#39;s role in two world wars, culminating in the genocide of the Jews of Europe and other minorities up to 1945. The third lecture will discuss how the Germans got out of the catastrophe of World War II and how, with Allied help, they reconstructed their political system, their economy, and their intellectual and cultural life, raising the question of their capacity to learn from a horrific past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volker Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, specializes in modern German history and European-American relations. He received his M.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1961) and his Ph.D. from the University of London (1964). He taught in England and Germany before coming to Brown University in 1988 and to Columbia ten years later. His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;America and the Intellectual Cold Wars in Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2001);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quest for Economic Empire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ed., 1996);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imperial Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(1995);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Americanization of West German Industry, 1945-1973&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1986);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Germany&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1982);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Der Tirpitz-Plan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1971);&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Europe in the Era of Two World Wars (2006);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and most recentl&lt;em&gt;y Industriegesellschaft und Kulturtransfer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(2010).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lectures are free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;IN-PERSON REGISTRATION IS CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;.

This fall, the seminar series will spotlight the work of CPRC members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julien Teitler &lt;/strong&gt;Professor of Social Work and Sociology. He is a member of CPRC&amp;rsquo;s steering committee and co-directs the Computing and Methods Core. Teitler&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on social determinants of health and fertility. Recent studies include cross-national comparisons of fertility trends, health, and health disparities; the effect of neighborhood racial composition on birth outcomes; the measurement of neighborhood contexts; the health trajectories of immigrants in the U.S.; and the consequences of elective Caesarians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Rundle&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; research focuses on the determinants of sedentary lifestyles and obesity and the health related consequences of these conditions. Andrew Rundle Co-directs the Built Environment and Health Research Group (beh.columbia.edu), a trans-disciplinary team of researchers studying how neighborhood built and social environments influence health, particularly physical activity and obesity risk. His work on urban design and neighborhood-level effects on health has been used as part of the scientific rationale for the New York City Active Design Guidelines and for the Mayor&amp;#39;s Food Policy Task Force&amp;#39;s Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) initiative. His work has been nationally recognized and he and his team are inaugural members of the American Institute of Architects Design and Health Research Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;",

The text for this publication originated in 2014 in reaction to Russia&amp;rsquo;s initial invasion into Ukraine and was completed amid anxiety about the presidential election in the United States. The texts are written in the language of absurdity grounded in a feminist critique of the persistent presence of war. G&amp;eacute;rard&amp;rsquo;s drawings taken from the French dictionary&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Petit Larousse&lt;/em&gt;, published in Paris in 1942 during the Nazi Occupation, appear alongside T&amp;euml;mkina&amp;rsquo;s texts. The artist was a small child then and it was encouraging for him to look at the images of athletes playing traditional male sports. In imagery of fighting cavemen, fragmented dinosaurs, sportsmen, and combative games, G&amp;eacute;rard contends with the dissonance between play and violence, strength and growth, and word and image. These original drawings are presented at the Harriman Institute for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This exhibition focuses on the traumatic consequences of war for children&amp;rsquo;s psyches. What images and feelings does our conscience carry throughout life? Why do we, the children of the war and post-war period baby boomers, return to this experience of the family and collective traumas again and again? The exhibition includes T&amp;euml;mkina&amp;rsquo;s cycle of twelve texts &amp;ldquo;Children Who Starve&amp;rdquo; about the psychological self-negation as a result of food deprivation that children of the war experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is co-organized with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.russianamericanculture.com/\"&gt;Russian American Cultural Center.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

This two-part LC will consider these questions and the effect of interdisciplinary teaching more broadly. Among the goals of this LC is to consider the benefits of constructing a unified academy and what effect interdisciplinarity has on our students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Graduate student instructors at Columbia encounter students of every major and academic background, particularly in courses taught as part of the core curriculum and language instruction. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching is a valuable method by which to engage students across academic interests. It also supports students&amp;rsquo; learning across disciplines, highlights&amp;nbsp;how knowledge interconnects between academic departments, and encourages students to pursue their own interdisciplinary approach to learning. This LC is intended for participants from all academic disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and will be co-facilitated by Marissa Swan and Emma Leidy, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;sessions of this LC.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The ship hull ceiling&amp;mdash;a wooden structure resembling an inverted ship in construction and design&amp;mdash;was an adaptable building solution that flourished in the Upper Adriatic region of the Italian peninsula between c. 1300-1450. Ceilings were constructed using wood sourced from local forests, where timber was extracted, prepared, and transported through complex processes and infrastructures. This talk will examine how local timber extraction endowed artisans with the expertise to select wood suited to the needs of each ceiling and to navigate the numerous stages of preparing the raw materials. Additionally, Laura Hutchingame will highlight the innovative techniques that emerged from the dialogue between carpenters and nautical craftsmen and shed light on the diverse forms of labor that contributed to the production of ship hull ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Laura Hutchingame, PhD student in Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/laura-hutchingame-crafting-ship-hull-ceilings-registration-1014709672947\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

The Spanish Empire built its first penal colony in San Ram&amp;oacute;n, Zamboanga, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Instead of sending deportees, Spanish officials incarcerated Filipinos to &amp;ldquo;try out&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;ensayar&amp;rdquo; in the documents) new methods of colonization through agriculture and the displacement of non-normative bodies from North (Manila) to South (Zamboanga). The project looks at the racial, ethical, political, and social issues involved in the penal colonization process in the Philippines. It exposes the legacies of colonial incarceration in the uses of the San Ram&amp;oacute;n prison, which still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://span-port.yale.edu/people/aurelie-vialette\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aur&amp;eacute;lie Vialette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Yale University, Department of Spanish and Portuguese), specializes in 19th-century Iberian cultural studies, focusing on the Filipino and Catalan contexts and engaging with acarcerality, disability, transatlantic movements, slavery networks, archives, popular music, journalist discourses, mass and working-class organizations.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Join Kristen Slesar, LCSW, for this engaging workshop that dives deep into the complexities of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Common misconceptions still persist today, like the idea that leaving an abusive partner ends the abuse. Questions like &amp;quot;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t she just leave?&amp;quot; continue to oversimplify the real dangers victims face&amp;mdash;dangers so severe that at least three women are murdered daily by current or former partners. Definitions of IPV that focus on individual acts of violence as opposed to coercive control perpetuate misconceptions and ineffective interventions that frequently fail to keep victims safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This workshop presents a comprehensive framework to understanding IPV within the context of social, relational, and structural entrapment. This framework will demonstrate how victims are ensnared not only by the coercive controlling violence of their partners but also by the societal, cultural, and political systems that generate vulnerability and fail to keep victims safe. Utilizing research and poignant case studies, Kristen will challenge participants to explore how centering coercive control as the underlying mechanism of IPV and treating IPV as a social&amp;mdash;and social justice&amp;mdash;problem is required to create more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;For development professionals focused on financing small business growth, understanding value drivers and how financial institutions invest in SMEs can offer valuable lessons for application in the developing world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;This session, led by Mr. de Mojana, will explore how value creation can boost innovation and growth, particularly in finance-constrained regions. He will discuss the characteristics of a robust financial system that can support dynamic and competitive SMEs and provide insights on applying these models to developing economies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBackground:&lt;br /&gt;\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in driving economic growth and fostering bottom-up development worldwide. These businesses, led by local entrepreneurs and workers, are often more formal and employ more people than micro- enterprises, yet they still face challenges such as weak governance, limited management capacity, and restricted access to markets and financial services. In Europe, SMEs make up over 99% of all businesses, with nearly 23 million enterprises employing around 100 million people, accounting for two-thirds of total employment. SMEs are integral to economic resilience and innovation, making access to finance&amp;mdash;through well-functioning banking systems, venture capital, and supportive public policies&amp;mdash;essential for their sustained growth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn Africa, SMEs contribute up to 60% of employment and 40% of GDP in some countries, while in Latin America, they represent over 90% of businesses and are responsible for around 70% of employment. Asia&amp;#39;s economic landscape is similarly dominated by SMEs, which make up more than 95% of all enterprises and employ a significant portion of the workforce, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asia. These businesses are vital for economic development, innovation, and poverty reduction.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco de Mojana, Founder and CEO of Buono Ventures Holding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. de Mojana is a private equity and financial sector professional with a growth focused approach to value creation. He is Founder and CEO of Buono Ventures Holding, an Italian-based investment firm focused on supporting emerging businesses and brands with equity and sector expertise. Previously, he was a partner at Permira, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest European private equity firms from January 2004 until December 2018, where he was involved in a over 1.5 billion Euro of investments in the consumer and digital consumer space. From 2002 until 2004 he was the Co-founder and COO of a software knowledge management solution company later sold to Telefonica Group, and from 1997 until 2000 he was at McKinsey &amp;amp; Company in London and Milan. He is currently a member of the board of directors of several private companies in the consumer space. Mr. de Mojana holds a B.A in International Economics from Universit&amp;agrave; Bocconi in Milan, and an MBA from Columbia University Business School in New York.&lt;/p&gt;",

It gained accolades from linguists and users alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yuri Shevchuk&amp;#39;s Ukrainian-English Collocation Dictionary is a highly welcome addition to Ukrainian lexicology, the first of its kind to present the most frequently found combinations of Ukrainian words in a modern setting with fluid, pitch-perfect English translations. It will be a major reference for students learning Ukrainian, for travelers, and for advanced speakers of Ukrainian, who will profit from its wide-ranging morphological, syntactic and lexical detail.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Michael S. Flier, the Oleksander Potebnia Professor of Ukrainian Philology, Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shevchuk has not only produced an infinitely helpful resource for anyone interested in Ukrainian, but given us one of the most breathtaking scholarly achievements in Slavonic Studies in many years.

The sheer abundance and quality of information in Shevchuk&amp;#39;s entries should make his dictionary a primary source that translators and learners should go to in seeking translations of Ukrainian words and expressions. Shevchuk&amp;#39;s collocation dictionary, the first of its kind for any Slavic language, should also serve as a useful template for future compilers of similarly constructed dictionaries for the Slavic world. . . . a remarkable contribution to Ukrainian lexicology that will have meaningful impact for decades to come.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash; Slavic Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Widespread access to generative AI is changing design practices as we speak. In this summit we will ask how this is happening and how to evaluate it &amp;ndash; politically, socially, technically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although the question of artificial intelligence has a long history, things have changed so dramatically in recent years that some thinkers have suggested that we have entered an era of post-human design. We will focus on the short history of generative AI, machine learning, and predictive algorithms and the explosion of tools and methods which open access to them has produced. Thanks to diffusion and large language models, which have become regular collaborators in many design processes, designers have the ability to talk to computers in ordinary language and ask them to do complicated things, like code, draw on archives, analyze and optimize data, even build new models and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will consider the implications of this explosion across all scales of practice at GSAPP, and the difference it is already making, in a day-long gathering November 1, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a series of panels, participants will present their work and discuss how their methods and practices have altered with new AI tools. We will ask about the difference between human and algorithmic intelligence. We will see how AI can be designed locally with local knowledge. We will address the systems architecture and politics behind AI in a more-than- human world. We will speculate on future modes of design practice that generative AI allows, or does not allow. We will query our queries &amp;ndash; text to image, text to code, text to video, text to the unknown in the future. We will assess quantitative versus qualitative measures guiding AI policies in urban contexts, as well as what might motivate parameters in urban design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, we hope to have introduced and interrogated the affordances of these new tools in relation to what we do as designers. The conference will include participatory methods intended to gather the perspectives of the audience and the speakers. It is our hope that the findings can be used as the basis for future discussion about AI and its impact on design environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAIG_t_fQzxmBBVeyoVPssmrzfayOt9NmEWaqFNFqaqzph4w/viewform?usp=sf_link\"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to register for the conference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Looking for a supportive place to try out instructional approaches? This Practice Teaching session (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Microteaching&amp;rdquo;) will pair you with a trained peer facilitator and a group of 3-4 other graduate students. Together, you and your fellow participants will take turns delivering short (&amp;lt;10 min.) samples of instruction to each other. After each teaching sample, your facilitator and your peers will offer structured feedback to support your teaching. Whether you are currently teaching at Columbia or not, all graduate students looking to practice teaching are welcome to attend this Practice Teaching session.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some teaching skills you could practice at this session include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introducing new content, concepts, or skills to students (i.e., an engaging mini-lecture)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Testing new and varied modes of student engagement to boost participation and inclusivity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using of visuals (blackboard, whiteboard, slide decks, handouts, etc.) to bolster learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitating discussion (i.e., posing discussion questions, monitoring student engagement, attention, and learning, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participants should determine which skill they wish to focus on and come prepared with something to teach their peers in an active and engaging way. Registrants will be provided additional guidance to help prepare for Practice Teaching in the week prior to the session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Practice Teaching sessions are facilitated by CTL&amp;#39;s trained graduate student Teaching Consultants. These sessions satisfy the &amp;ldquo;Application and Practice&amp;rdquo; requirement in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://tdp.ctl.columbia.edu/\"&gt;Teaching Development Program&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

For example, for deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, aligning the nuclear spins parallel to the magnetic field increases the cross section by a factor of 1.5. Because fusion reaction products will heat the fuel ions in a fusion reactor, a 50% increase in cross section nearly doubles the fusion power, relaxing the requirements to achieve a practical fusion reactor. Furthermore, the higher probability of a reaction substantially reduces the required tritium inventory. A key question is: will spin polarized fuel remain polarized in a fusion reactor environment? Theoretically, the two most important depolarization mechanisms are hyperfine interactions with bound electrons and resonances with electromagnetic waves at nuclear precession frequencies&amp;mdash;the process that occurs in magnetic resonance imaging. For reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll explain, despite the rich spectrum of electromagnetic waves in the fusion environment, it is theoretically predicted that the polarization lifetime will exceed the amount of time the fuel spends in the plasma. Plans to measure the polarization lifetime on the DIII-D tokamak using cryogenic LiD and 3He shell pellets will be discussed, as well as prospects for experiments at other facilities.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;: William &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; Heidbrink is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy in the School of Physical Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Heidbrink earned his B.A. degree from the University of California, San Diego in 1977. For the next two years he performed industrial research in pulsed power at Maxwell Laboratories. In 1984, he received his Ph.D. from Princeton University. After working as a staff member on the TFTR tokamak (Princeton) and the DIII-D tokamak (General Atomics), he joined the UCI Physics Department in 1988. He also has won the UCI &amp;quot;Lauds and Laurels&amp;quot; Distinguished Teaching Award and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 2004, he received the Excellence in Plasma Physics Research award from the Americal Physical Society. Professor Heidbrink&amp;#39;s research involves studies of &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; ions in magnetized plasma.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis talk will be offered in a hybrid format.

In our observational studies, we have investigated how different biomarkers relate to each other over time, and how they associate to diseases and drug treatments. Using large data sets including genotypes and Swedish national registers, we apply causal inference methods to provide stronger causal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Describing a governmental approach that simultaneously incentivizes a can-do spirit and suppresses dissent, the book points out resonances between authoritarian and neoliberal ideologies in today&amp;#39;s comeback of strongman rule. Drawing on field observations, in-depth interviews, and analyses of video clips, it conveys the look and feel of flexible authoritarianism in Russia through the eyes of up-and-coming youth. The author analyzes ways in which the insignia of cool start-up capitalism and familiar cultural forms such as the summer camp help stabilize the regime, while also showing how up-and-coming youth both embrace and contest loyalty to the government.&lt;/p&gt;",

This seminar will present results from two studies on disparities in healthy life expectancy among older Americans. In the first, we analyzed the health and economic well-being of five cohorts of Americans in their mid-fifties between 1994 and 2018, focusing on the middle of the economic distribution. Using a dynamic microsimulation based on the Health and Retirement Study, we simulated their future life-course, including estimating health-quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). We found QALE for the upper-middle income group had increased between cohorts, but it stagnated for their lower-middle peers. Economic outcomes followed similar patterns. The results suggest the relatively neglected &amp;ldquo;forgotten middle&amp;rdquo; group of near-retirees may require stronger supports than are currently available to them. In the second study, we similarly used a microsimulation to estimate QALE at age 60 for rural and urban Americans. We found substantial disparities in QALE for rural men relative to their urban counterparts, with much smaller differences for women, and these gaps had grown larger over time. Counterfactual scenarios suggested eliminating smoking and managing obesity and prevalent heart conditions would be particularly beneficial for increasing rural QALE and reducing this urban-rural gap. However, the results suggested interventions earlier in life might be needed to fully address the urban-rural disparity in QALE at older ages. The seminar will conclude with a brief overview of some future research efforts to identify solutions to these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

EVI1 is part of the MECOM (MDS1-EVI1 Combination) locus, from which the long form MDS1-EVI1 and the short form EVI1 are transcribed from two different promoters. Although EVI1 is expressed at high levels, MDS1-EVI1 is absent or expressed at very low levels in inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs. Overexpression of EVI1 in inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs is caused by the relocation of a long distant enhancer of GATA2, originally situated at chromosome 3q21. Enhancer hijacking by EVI1 has not only been found in the classical inv(3)/t(3;3)-AMLs, but also in other 3q26 rearranged variants, e.g. t(2;3), t(3;7), t(3;8) or multiple other t(3;v) leukemias. Most enhancers hijacked in those leukemias represent socalled super-enhancers and are donated by genes that are normally expressed in primitive HSPCs. Our research focusses on the common mechanism of those enhancers to drive EVI1 overexpression. We address which combination of transcription factors (TF) drive transcription via the hijacked enhancers and how we may interfere with the activity of the TF/enhancer complex. We hypothesize that this knowledge will provide ways to target this otherwise incurable form of AML. In a second project, we obtain knowledge about the function of EVI1. EVI1 encodes a DNA binding repressor of transcription. Interference with its function as a repressor may provide another way to inhibit outgrowth of this leukemia. In this lecture, the mechanism of aberrant expression as well as the role EVI1 in MECOM rearrangement AMLs will be discussed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/SZDZ6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1130 St. Nicholas Ave., New York, NY 10032&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/SZDZ6\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Room/Area: 1st floor auditorium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Aaron Viny, MD, Assistant Professor of Genetics &amp;amp; Development, CUMC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is sponsored by the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;#39;s (HICCC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/research/researchers/edward-p-evans-center-myelodysplastic-syndromes-mds\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Edward P.

In &lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt;, a poet&amp;#39;s life is turned inside out by a sudden, wrenching pain. The pain brings him to his knees, and eventually to the ICU. Confined to bed, plunged into the dysfunctional American healthcare system, he struggles to understand what is happening to his body, as someone who has lived for many years in his mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt; is a searching, sweeping novel set at the furthest edges of human experience, where the forces that give life value--art, memory, poetry, music, care--are thrown into sharp relief. Time expands and contracts. Sudden intimacies bloom. &lt;em&gt;Small Rain&lt;/em&gt; surges beyond the hospital to encompass a radiant vision of human life: our shared vulnerability, the limits and possibilities of sympathy, the ideal of art and the fragile dream of America. Above all, it is a love story of the most unexpected kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Garth Greenwell is the author of &lt;em&gt;What Belongs to You&lt;/em&gt;, which won the British Book Award for Debut of the Year, was longlisted for the National Book Award, and was a finalist for many other awards, including the PEN/Faulkner and the LA Times Book Prize. His second work of fiction, &lt;em&gt;Cleanness&lt;/em&gt;, was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award and a New York Times Notable Book.&amp;nbsp;His nonfiction appears widely, and he writes regularly about culture for the Substack newsletter &lt;a href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgarthgreenwell.substack.com%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cknm2136%40cumc.columbia.edu%7C1c5eb376e07741f400c608dcacc97f45%7Cb0002a9b0017404d97dc3d3bab09be81%7C0%7C0%7C638575229888173806%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=QGWd1%2BJUNwWR5w5ulMZwUxNSg3vApEDDQ%2Fx%2BTt1iHxY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;To a Green Thought&lt;/a&gt;. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Harold D.

These deep inequities determine the disparate health experiences of rich and poor, Black and white, men and women, immigrant and native-born, boss and worker, Indigenous and settler. This book underscores that powerful people and institutions have always seen some lives as more valuable than others, and it emphasizes how those who have been most affected by the disparities in rates of disease and death have challenged and changed these systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

He will focus on the small but critical &amp;ldquo;window of opportunity&amp;rdquo; in the negotiation process when de-escalation is possible: &amp;ldquo;This brief period of reflection and weighing options creates the potential for cooperation, but it is essential to act quickly. Failure to recognize or seize this opportunity can result in full-scale escalation. The importance of timely action in preventing a full-blown conflict will be a key theme of the discussion.&amp;rdquo; Following a presentation and conversation, there will be time for audience questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zoom link will be distributed to all registrants 24 hours in advance of the webinar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Kjerstin Pugh (kep2137@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

Dodman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the first hundred years following legal emancipation across the French empire in 1848, in what ways did autobiographical narratives, prose fiction, and poetry address the continuation of black unfreedom? In this talk, A. V&amp;eacute;ronique Charles examines literary constructs of unfreedom within early twentieth-century Black literary production alongside bound fugitive slave narratives that circulated between Senegal and the metropole in the 1880s. This literary periodization specifically predates the institutional study of the respective fields of Caribbean and African literature. Charles notably charts a literary problem space through which readers can parse slavery&amp;rsquo;s past in canonical and lesser-known writings by Senegalese, Reunionese, and Antillean intellectuals, or &amp;eacute;volu&amp;eacute;s, whose citizenship dates back to nineteenth-century abolition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;The NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp is a two-day intensive boot camp combining lectures, hands-on activities, and discussions to demystify the NIH application process. This training will prepare participants to submit an NIH grant proposal that turns reviewers into advocates, positioning the applicant for success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2-day NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp: Building a Strong Foundation for Funding Success will provide comprehensive training that supplies researchers with the tools to write persuasive, effective grant proposals. Through a combination of seminars, discussions, examples, and hands-on activities, with a particular focus on navigating between-the-lines on how to tailor your proposals to grant reviewers, this training will orient you to all aspects of the academic funding process (i.e., grant writing and grant strategizing), including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to identify and apply for the right funding opportunities with the NIH (and beyond);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to position your research and yourself to make reviewers your research advocates;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to target your application to the right place at the right time; and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to write clearly, effectively, and persuasively when telling your scientific story.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Audience and Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators from any institution and from all career stages are welcome to attend, and we particularly encourage trainees and early-stage investigators to participate. No prior experience in preparing or submitting NIH grant applications is necessary. However, each participant should be prepared to share* and work on an NIH Specific Aims page and an NIH biosketch. Participants who have not previously written an NIH-style Aims page and/or biosketch will have an opportunity to draft their page and receive initial feedback ahead of the on-site workshop. There are no other requirements to attend the NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*Hands-on activities will use participant aims pages, and we therefore request that all participants respect the confidentiality of other attendees. Any participant who prefers not to share their research ideas may create a mock aims page to use during the boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbia.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=60d3eb536eacd93ffd4c56c08&amp;amp;id=8909a5c93b\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Subscribe for updates on new Boot Camp details and registration deadlines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:Columbia.GrantWriting@gmail.com\"&gt;Contact the NIH Grant Writing Boot Camp team.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Capacity\u202fis\u202flimited.

Using the case of labor mobilization in Belarus, the study examines cross-sector variation in civil resistance. It is hypothesized that the degree of the spatial concentration of employees and a prior record of labor activism in certain industries shapes the choice of the methods of resistance to the regime. Data for this study come from in-depth interviews with Belarusian labor activists and social media. A close analysis of labor mobilization in Belarus contributes to the political science literature by demonstrating diverse ways in which industrial workers might engage in resistance to the authoritarian regime.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This presentation offers insights from the 4-OCEANS project, a comprehensive initiative exploring human-marine interactions throughout history, and presents specific findings on climate-economy dynamics in early modern Europe. The 4-OCEANS project addresses three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When and where was marine exploitation significantly impactful on human society?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How did socio-economic, cultural, and environmental forces influence marine exploitation?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What were the consequences of marine exploitation for societal development and ocean ecosystems?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within this broader context, we focus on a case study examining climate-economy interactions in early modern Europe (1565-1785). Using advanced econometric techniques, we analyze how climate variability and socio-political factors affected food prices across 14 European cities. Our findings reveal that extreme weather events, particularly when coinciding with periods of conflict like the Thirty Years&amp;#39; War, significantly impacted price dynamics and market integration. This research contributes directly to the 4-OCEANS project by illuminating the complex interplay between environmental factors, human activities, and economic systems over time. By examining these historical patterns, we gain insights into the long-term consequences of human-environment interactions, addressing the project&amp;#39;s core questions about the impacts and drivers of marine exploitation. These findings not only deepen our historical knowledge but also inform current debates on climate change, resource management, and economic resilience, demonstrating the relevance of the 4-OCEANS project to contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ccsr.columbia.edu/people/michael-puma\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Michael Puma&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Research Scientist at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://emiledesmaili.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Emile Esmaili&lt;/a&gt;, Research Assistant at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to Columbia University ID holders; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-oceans-to-markets-marine-exploitation-and-climate-economy-dynamics-tickets-1049569309057\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the History and Climate Change workshop series hosted by the &lt;a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/content/research-cluster-environmental-sciences-and-humanities\"&gt;Environmental Sciences and Humanities Research Cluster&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Science and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Center for Science and Society makes every reasonable effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

    "description": "Stitches To Hold the World TogetherIn the workshop series, we will be focusing on understanding the ways in which women's traditions of stitching have helped them to \"hold their worlds together\" in the face of displacement, poverty, enslavement, war, isolation, and other challenges. We will celebrate the resiliency of their traditions as we learn about them and get to make them ourselves.\nIn our first workshop, we made traditional French Biscornu (meaning \u201cbizarre\u201d) pincushions, a tradition that emerged after the Nazi occupation in the Second World War as a way to use small scraps to replace traditional stitchery tools that had been lost in the war.\nIn this second workshop, we will be making hand-pieced friendship star blocks. In the 19th Century, women in the young United States began to make patchwork as a way to use and re-use expensive industrially milled fabrics, often in imitation of English chintz patterns that were outlawed for purchase in the U.S. One of the patterns that emerged in this time was the \"friendship star,\" a patchwork pattern that connected small patches into a star shape. These came to be known as friendship stars because it became a common practice among young women to make and give star blocks to their friends as tokens; these would be sewn together by the recipients with blocks from other friends to make an \"album\" quilt that would help them to remember friends who they might not see after they married, and as more people began to move around the U.S. to follow work or head westward. These friendship star album quilts attest to the close relationships among women built as they stitched together that survived the rapid changes as the U.S. became more urban, industrial, and mobile.\nThis is an easy project for every level of sewer, especially beginners. They make excellent gifts for friends.\nThe workshop starts at noon and the learning part is completed by 12:30pm\u2014after that is just hanging out and stitching together. Come for a little or all.\nSupplies will be provided. Coffee, tea, and snacks, and good company. All are welcome\u2014students, staff, and faculty. This event is underwritten by funds from the late Jean Roland, long a supported of the Bertha Harris Women's Center.\nWatch for the rest of our workshops this fall, noon-2:00pm in 2N/106:\nW 11.6 Visible Mending, Boro-style\nTu 11.19 Kantha-Style Needlebook\nW 12.4 Palestinian Tatreez Embroidery\nAlso, join us for ongoing drop-in mending workshops throughout the fall, 1:00pm-3:00pm in 2N/106; come learn how to repair your clothing instead of trashing it, how to live fashionably AND more sustainably, and to amaze your friends with your button-sewing skills: Tu, 10.29; M, 11.4; and Tu, 11.12.

As soon as the existence of an attractor is determined, one would like to know if it persists in a family of systems and in which way i.e. its stability. Attractors of one-dimensional systems are well understood, and their stability as well. I will discuss attractors of two-dimensional systems, starting with the special case of Henon maps. In this setting very little is understood. Already to determine the existence of an attractor is a very difficult problem. I will survey the known results and discuss the new developments in the understanding of attractors, coexistence of attractors and their stability for two-dimensional dynamical systems.\n\nDate:\nOctober 22, 2024\nTime:\n12:30 PM \u2014 1:30 PM\nCollege:\nThe City College of New York\nAddress:\nCity College of NY, 160 Convent Avenue, New York, NY 10031\nManhattan\nBuilding:\nNorth Academic Center, Room 6/113\nPhone:\n(212)650-5346\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/seminar/mathematics-colloquium/talk/245/",

    "description": "We invite you to an engaging conversation between\u00a0Voices of Light\u00a0composer\u00a0Richard Einhorn\u00a0and Music Director and Conductor David Hayes, at the Mannes School of Music at The New School. They\u2019ll discuss the inspiration behind this moving piece, how it was created, the difficulties of composing and conducting for film, and the lasting impact of the film\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc.Free to the public, but space is limited. Please RSVP.Wollman Hall, The New SchoolEugene Lang Building, Room B50065 West 11th StreetAbout the upcoming performance of Voices of LightOn\u00a0November 1, 2024, the New York Choral Society will present\u00a0Voices of Light, a work by New York native Richard Einhorn, for orchestra, soloists, and chorus. This compelling piece will be paired with the legendary\u00a0silent film\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, which chronicles the trial and torment of Joan of Arc in the hours leading up to her execution.Starring the famous Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise actress Ren\u00e9e Falconetti, this recently restored 1928 film, originally censored by the Catholic Church, offers a unique opportunity for both film and music lovers to experience the movie on a large screen at\u00a0Alice Tully Hall, in partnership with the\u00a0Mannes Orchestra.\u00a0This production has been made possible through the generous support of the Martin L. Finkelman Bequest.Featured Soloists:\u00a0THE POLYPHONISTSAmy Broadbent, SopranoSylvia Leith, Mezzo-SopranoMatthew Hill, TenorEdmund Milly, Bass-BaritoneVoices of Light November 1 at Alice Tully Hall-TicketsAbout Voices of LightVoices of Light\u00a0is an oratorio by New York native Richard Einhorn, inspired by\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, the iconic 1928 silent film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The piece uses a libretto based on excerpts from ancient writings, predominantly those of medieval female mystics, including texts directly from Joan of Arc\u2019s accusers and her own responses.This composition employs a multi-layered musical structure designed to evoke the polyphonic music of Joan\u2019s era, featuring a dramatically slowed-down Gregorian chant overlaid with multiple Texts.About The Passion of Joan of ArcThe film,\u00a0The Passion of Joan of Arc, is considered a masterpiece of cinema, known for its stark portrayal of the emotional depth of its protagonist, portrayed by Ren\u00e9e Falconetti in a legendary performance that remains a touchstone of film acting. The film\u2019s visual style, coupled with Einhorn\u2019s moving composition, creates an immersive experience that has captivated audiences worldwide. Influencing directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg, (and boasting a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), this film has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Previously lost to fire and believed destroyed, a perfect copy of the film was discovered and has been meticulously restored, allowing modern audiences to experience Dreyer\u2019s visionary work as it was originally intended.",

    "title": "Film screening Emergent Cities and dialogue with participants from The Sunset Park is not for Sale Oral History Project",
    "description": "Join us for a screening of the newly released documentary Emergent City, which captures one of the most intense community battles against real estate development in recent history. The screening will be followed by a conversation with filmmaker Kelly Anderson and community members featured in the film, who are also part of the Sunset Park is Not for Sale Oral History Project.\u00a0About the Documentary FilmOver a decade, within the borders of a single Brooklyn community district, a microcosm of American democracy emerges. Residents of Sunset Park face a tangled web of rising rents, a legacy of environmental racism and the loss of the industrial jobs that once sustained their community. When a global developer purchases Industry City - a massive industrial complex on the waterfront - and begins to transform it into an \u201cinnovation district,\u201d a battle erupts over the future of the neighborhood and of New York City itself.Emergent City\u00a0is an observational civic epic. It sheds light on power and process, illuminating systems and giving viewers a front row seat to the public and private spaces where the city is shaped. With extraordinary access, it tracks an ensemble of participants including the local council member, Industry City\u2019s developers and community members with divergent stakes. The film explores the profound intersections of gentrification, climate crisis and real estate development, and asks how change might emerge from dialogue and collective action in a world where too many outcomes are constrained by money, politics and business as usual.For more information about the documentary film, click here.\u00a0Panelists\u00a0Kelly Anderson, Director and Producer of Emergent CityKelly Anderson is a Sunset Park based documentary filmmaker whose most recent film is\u00a0Rabble Rousers: Frances Goldin and the Fight for Cooper Square\u00a0(w. Ryan Joseph and Kathryn Barnier). Her 2012 film\u00a0My Brooklyn, about the hidden forces driving gentrification, was broadcast on PBS\u2019\u00a0America ReFramed. Kelly produced and directed\u00a0Every Mother\u2019s Son\u00a0(PBS, 2004, w. Tami Gold), about mothers whose children were killed by police, which won the Tribeca Audience Award and aired on POV. She produced and directed\u00a0Out At Work\u00a0(HBO, 2000, w. Tami Gold), which premiered at Sundance. Kelly chairs the Department of Film and Media Studies at Hunter College (CUNY).\u00a0Jay Arthur Sterrenberg, Director and Producer of Emergent CityJay Arthur Sterrenberg is a New York City based director and editor.

Jay is a co-founder of the Sunset Park based Meerkat Media Collective. His short documentary Public Money (PBS, 2018) is an observed portrait of an experiment in participatory democracy in Sunset Park.\u00a0Marcela Mitaynes, Assembly member representing 51st District in Brooklyn (To be confirmed)Marcela Mitaynes is a Peruvian-American politician and tenant organizer, currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly. She represents the 51st District as a Democrat, which includes Red Hook, Sunset Park, and northern Bay Ridge in Brooklyn.Through her work with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, and with tenants throughout New York State, Marcela was instrumental in the passage of the historic Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. This legislation dramatically and comprehensively strengthened the rights of tenants in rent-stabilized apartments to defend their homes and communities.\u00a0Marcela is continuing to organize in the district and help build power for working class people. All New Yorkers deserve access to housing, health care and energy. We need to build a mass, working-class movement to win a future where working-class people have a chance to live dignified lives.",

    "title": "Special Pre-release Film Screening Opens and Closes: The Future of Edinburgh\u2019s Histories",
    "description": "\u00a0\"Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful and everything conceals something else.\"\u2014Italo CalvinoThis is a film about how cities imagine their futures and the methods they use to manage them. Today, the future looms over cities in a hyperconnected tangle of crises. Sharpening inequalities, carbon climate feedback, technological acceleration, and opaque financial infrastructures combine in a clamor for new ideas, new plans, and new methods. But city futures are never just about cities and they are never just about futures; they are about policies and deals, actors and sectors, ideas and theories, instruments and methods. They are about places, sunk in space, meshed across regions and nations and curved across the globe. They are inherently and dynamically relational and radically contingent. Between the acknowledged past and the imagined future, the lines connecting land and water, science and industry, government and universities, people and money, are the formula, the twisted helix meant to fix the trouble we\u2019re in.A film by:Sapphire GossProduced, written, and narrated by:Prof Liz McFall,\u00a0University of EdinburghDiscussion by:- John Bruce\u00a0-\u00a0School of Design Strategies, Parsons- Evren Uzer, PhD\u00a0-\u00a0School of Design Strategies, ParsonsSapphire Goss is a British artist who works with experimental moving image and photographic processes to create an \u2018analogue uncanny\u2019.

This was an invitation to think about the corrosive state-enforced obedient and hagiographic history being churned out of universities and publishing houses. This is a history that insisted there is only one narrative at every bend of Bangladesh's journey since the partition of British India.

Renfield is drugged by the eerily hypnotic count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to London. After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then calls in a specialist, Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's health. Van Helsing, realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's fiance, John Harker, and Dr. Seward for what is to come and the measures that will have to be taken to prevent Mina from becoming one of the undead.\u2014Doug Sederberg (sonic.net)\u00a0Dracula (1931)Directors: Tod Browning, Karl FreundWriters: Bram Stoker, Hamilton Deane, John L.

Andrea Geyer, Adam HajYahia, and Carlos Motta discuss their work as artists, researchers, and curators to explore approaches to recuperating and rehistoricizing the obscured and erased pasts of women, queer people, and sex workers. More than simply rewriting inclusive histories and expanding the canon, queer approaches to historiography question the very construction of history as a singular, linear, universal experience that undergirds both the creation and the dismantling of empire, nationhood, and heteropatriarchy.

Their conversation oscillates between their work as scholars and researchers in institutional settings as well as their personal and bodily experience within them, grappling with the challenges and opportunities for intervening, altering, and amending archives, museums, and other history-bearing institutions, with the awareness that they are already revisionist accounts of the past. Speaking to individual and communal practices and legacies, they discuss the role of objects and rituals in reckoning with history, narrating counter histories, and the potential for solidarity and liberation across past and ongoing struggles.This event is part of the Vera List Center Forum 2024: Correct* History, please visit here for more information.",

    "title": "Peter Fenves & Susan Shell: Thoughts on Kant\u2019s First Book, which Is Presumed to Have Been a Failure",
    "description": "This paper seeks to show that Kant\u2019s first book, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces, has been almost universally misunderstood. Largely overlooked by scholars of Kantian thought in particular and modern German philosophy in general, the book is generally seen by the few scholars who have looked into it as a failed attempt to solve the so-called vis viva controversy\u2014which had been solved by D\u2019Alembert and Boscovich a few years before Kant set down his \u201cthoughts.\u201d This paper argues, however, that the aim of Kant\u2019s first book does not lie in the resolution of the vis viva controversy and proposes three other aims instead: that Kant was writing something akin to a work of auto-fiction about the strivings of a young scholar; that Kant was seeking the origin of the controversy over \u201cliving forces\u201d in what phenomenologists would later call \u201clived experience\u201d; and that Kant was looking beyond modern-Galilean mechanics toward a meta-mechanics allowed for locally defined violations of force-conservation laws. The locus of all three aims lies in Kant\u2019s curious invention of \u201cintension\u201d as a replacement of Newtonian vis inertia. The larger aim of the paper is to consider whether Kant\u2019s last writings return to the point where he abandoned his first book and fell into his first silent period.Bio:The Joan and Serapta Professor of Literature at Northwestern University, Peter Fenves is a Professor of German, Comparative Literary Studies, and Jewish Studies. He is the author of several books, including Arresting Language\u2014From Leibniz to Benjamin (2001), Late Kant: Toward Another Law of the Earth (2003; translated into German and Spanish), and The Messianic Reduction: Walter Benjamin and the Shape of Time (2011; translated into Spanish). He is also the editor or co-editor of numerous volumes, including Raising the Tone of Philosophy: Late Essays by Kant, Transformative Critique by Derrida (1993), Walter Benjamin, Toward the Critique of Violence: A Critical Edition (2021), and Walter Benjamin, On Goethe (2025).Susan Shell is the author of Kant and the Limits of Autonomy (Harvard University Press, 2009), The Embodiment of Reason: Kant on Spirit, Generation and Community (University of Chicago Press, (1996), The Rights of Reason: A Study of Kant's Philosophy and Politics (University of Toronto Press, 1980). She is also the co-editor (with Robert Faulkner) of America at Risk: Threats to Liberal Self-Government in an Age of Uncertainty (University of Michigan Press, 2009). She has also written on Rousseau, German Idealism, and selected areas of public policy. She has been a Visiting Professor at Harvard University, and received fellowships from The National Endowment for the Humanities, The American Council of Learned Societies, The Bradley Foundation, the Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst and the Radcliffe Institute.",

It focuses on the three main areas of sound, time, and technique, and is derived from Muscat's recent book Tone, Time, Tactic. He will share ideas he has used to shape his sound, learn tunes, and understand various aspects of the music. Muscat will also discuss methods for improving overall control and fluidity on wind instruments, which he developed from the teachings of the great saxophonist JD Allen. The methods also apply to other instruments since they are essential for ear training.Carlo MuscatRecognised as one of the most promising voices on the European jazz scene, Carlo Muscat's reputation as a saxophonist, composer, and bandleader has flourished through collaborations with numerous outstanding European musicians. His sixth album, Hymns, received critical acclaim, with a four-star rating from Downbeat Magazine and a spot on their Best Albums of 2023 list. This acknowledgement signalled his artistic development and emerging role in contemporary jazz. The eminent pianist Leo Genovese remarks, \"Carlo's sound and compositions are outstanding, and the interplay between him and the ensemble shows a very deep communication with the tradition of improvising music.\"An inventive improviser overtly embracing a willingness to explore new musical territories, Muscat's discography now includes seven albums as a leader and numerous contributions as a sideman. From his 2014 debut release, The Sound Catalogues, each album has probed a different aspect of his sound and experimented with compositional and stylistic approaches, reflecting his dedication to an ongoing pursuit of his musical vision. World-class pianist Aaron Goldberg says \"Carlo's fine taste is on display throughout\u2212lyrical music with a bounce, refreshing in its conceptual simplicity.\"His seventh album, The Body Is Only Light, was recorded in Kyiv on Sunday 24th March 2024 and is set to be released in October 2024 on the American label ears&eyes Records.",

    "description": "A book talk and concert with Dr. Jeremiah Lockwood and Cantor Yoel KohnGolden Ages is an ethnographic study of young singers in the contemporary Brooklyn Hasidic community who base their aesthetic explorations of the culturally intimate space of prayer on the gramophone-era cantorial golden age. Jeremiah Lockwood proposes a view of their work as a nonconforming social practice that calls upon the sounds and structures of Jewish sacred musical heritage to disrupt the aesthetics and power hierarchies of their conservative community, defying institutional authority and pushing at normative boundaries of sacred and secular. Beyond its role as a desirable art form, golden age cantorial music offers aspiring Hasidic singers a form of Jewish cultural productivity in which artistic excellence, maverick outsider status and sacred authority are aligned.In this book event, Lockwood will discuss his new book and accompany one of the singers featured in the study, Yoel Kohn, in a concert of virtuosic and soulful cantorial performance in the early 20th century \"golden age\" cantorial style.",

    "description": "Join the Zolberg Institute for a discussion with Emrah Y\u0131ld\u0131z, author of Zainab's Traffic.\u00a0What is the value\u2014religious, political, economic, or altogether\u00a0social\u2014of getting on a bus in Tehran to embark on an eight-hundred-mile journey across two international borders to the Sayyida Zainab shrine outside Damascus? Under what material conditions can such values be established, reassessed, or transgressed, and by whom?\u00a0Zainab\u2019s Traffic\u00a0provides answers to these questions alongside the socially embedded\u2014and spatially generative\u2014encounters of ritual, mobility, desire, genealogy, and patronage along the route. Whether it is through the study of the spatial politics of saint veneration in Islam, analysis of cross-border gold trade and sanctions, or examination of pilgrims women\u2019s desire for Syrian lingerie accompanying their pleas with the saint in marital matters, the book and this talk develops the idea of visitation as a ritual of mobility across geography, history, and category. Iranian visitors\u2019 experiences on the road to Sayyida Zainab\u2014emerging out of a self-described \u201cpoverty of mobility\u201d\u2014demonstrate the utility of a more capacious anthropological understanding of ritual than our current predicaments allow for. Rather than thinking of ritual as a scripturally canonized manual for pious self-cultivation,\u00a0Zainab\u2019s Traffic\u00a0approaches\u00a0ziyarat\u00a0as a traffic of pilgrims, goods, and ideas across Iran, Turkey, and Syria.",

    "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Sabeen Ahmed, \"Law and the Colonial Order of Things\"",
    "description": "Abstract: This paper explores the limits of philosophy of law in addressing the prevailing political crises of our time--the dissolution of the so-called \"rules based liberal order\" and the fascist underpinnings of \"Western\" politics--by considering an alternative approach to legal analysis grounded in a Foucauldian conception of nomos. To show how modern law serves to reproduce global inequalities and hierarchies by institutionalizing and naturalizing colonial relations of force, it reconsiders modern law through the framework of power. In doing so, it posits a new reading of modern law as a technology for upholding what An\u00edbal Quijano has called \"the Eurocentered capitalist colonial/modern world power,\" or what we can more simply understand as the colonial order of things.\u00a0Bio: Sabeen Ahmed is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Swarthmore College, where she works in the areas of social and political philosophy, philosophy of race, and anticolonial thought. Her teaching and scholarship take as their starting point the recognition that white supremacy is the defining political and existential problem of modernity, and that the discipline of philosophy has historically been implicated in this imperial reality. Her research and pedagogy are grounded in decolonial, antiracist, and anti-imperial commitments that bring global perspectives and historically marginalized voices to bear the major political (and thus philosophical) questions of our present.",

    "title": "New York City Graduate National Portfolio Day",
    "description": "What are National Portfolio Days?National Portfolio Days are annual events held in multiple locations across the United States, Canada and Europe. They are designed to provide a unique opportunity for you to meet individually with professional representatives of accredited art, design, and architecture colleges and universities. You'll be able to receive valuable feedback and guidance on your visual portfolio before you submit it as part of your admission application. Not all members schools attend each event. Visit nationalportfolioday.org for a complete list of schools attending each event, including November 10 in New York City.No admission decisions or scholarship awards will be offered to you at National Portfolio Days. Some college and university representatives may accept your portfolio as the visual portion of your application. Others have restrictions that prohibit them from making a definitive portfolio decision at the time of your review. All representatives will be happy to discuss their specific programs of study and provide answers to questions about the availability of scholarships and financial aid.You will not find National Portfolio Days to be an examination or competition; the events are about an exchange of information. The representatives want to learn about you, your work, and your post-secondary plans, all while informing you about their college or university and application requirements. These events may be the first time you have been in an environment with so many people in one place who all share a powerful commitment to art and design. Use this as an opportunity to be inspired, to gain advice as to how to improve or present your portfolio and to experience a small taste of what it is like to attend a professional art and design program.What is the National Portfolio Day Association?The National Portfolio Day Association (NPDA) was created in 1978 solely for the organization and planning of National Portfolio Days. The Association consists of representatives that hold regional accreditation and accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), or Substantial Equivalency status. NPDA is the only organization of its kind and the membership represents the highest standard of visual arts education available in the world.What should I bring to a National Portfolio Day?A portfolio of visual artwork that includes your best and most recent work, but it can also include works in progress, sketchbooks and tear sheets. Don\u2019t hesitate to explain how you develop your ideas and where you want to go with them. Often, sharing the process of arriving at the completed work is as valuable as simply presenting finished products. You will hear many different opinions about your work that will be reflective of the admission requirements of each school. Therefore, we urge you to discuss your work with as many colleges/universities as possible and to bring no more than 15 works. Your portfolio can be presented as original work or on screen, but make note wifi may not be available at all locations. Students who are not prepared to show a portfolio may attend to gather information from college/university representatives.All National Portfolio Day events are free and open to the public.",

The success of the modeling relies on a robust numerical method with the corresponding software that can handle the complex geometry, the complex fluid flows and run efficiently on a supercomputer. In this talk, we present a highly parallel domain decomposition method to solve the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a patient-specific artery at the full-body scale from neck to feet. Moreover, a two-level method is introduced to determine the model parameters in the Windkessel outlet boundary condition to guarantee clinically correct flow distributions to 14 major organs/regions. A fully implicit Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method with learning capabilities is used to solve the nonlinear algebraic system at each time step and numerical experiments show that the proposed method is robust with respect to the complex geometry, different model parameters, and is scalable with more than 10,000 processor cores.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBio: X.-C. Cai received his PhD in 1989 from Courant Institute. He was a postdoc during 1989-1990 at Yale University. After about 30 years in the Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder, he recently joined the Department of Mathematics, University of Macau, as a Chair Professor. His research interests are in the areas of large scale scientific computing and computational biomechanics. He is a fellow of SIAM.&lt;/p&gt;",

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/aleksandar-boskovic/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleksandar Bo&amp;scaron;kovi\u0107&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What was common in a Romanian MEP running on the list of Jean Marie Le Pen&amp;rsquo;s Front National (whose seat was probably bought by the Romanian Communist secret services), the mayor of the Slovenian city Murska Sobota in 1930, a Romanian politician in the Banat sitting on the board of directors of a local textile company, and the chairman of the Brasov bar association in the 1930s? All of them were linked to the defunct dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary to the extent that their actual behavior was a function of that imperial past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the research conducted by the team of the ERC-funded Nepostrans (Negotiating post-imperial transitions: from remobilization to nation-state consolidation. A comparative study of local and regional transitions in post-Habsburg East and Central Europe) research project, this talk will highlight the ways individuals who were anything but prominent before 1918 facilitated the persistence of imperial rule in Austria-Hungary&amp;rsquo;s successor states. Using examples from the administration, judiciary, symbolic spaces, ways of doing local politics, and patterns of corruption, Egry argues that practices those figures carried over from Austria-Hungary had their origins in the empire as a management of difference. Thus, these examples reveal a more systemic facet of post-imperial state-building than just ironic stories, they show how seemingly banal social practices helped create the empire from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;",

Examples of this shift include the surge in user studies aimed directly at assisting studied groups, rather than simply &amp;ldquo;examining&amp;rdquo; them, as well as research focused on making security technologies more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are valuable additions to our work. In this talk, however, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a different approach: What would security research look like if our goal were to shape public policy and help society at large?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will present several pieces of work from across my career, spanning different areas&amp;mdash;cryptography, user studies, and systems research&amp;mdash;that demonstrate that regardless of your sub-discipline, producing research that shapes policy is not only possible, but impactful.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Energy finance is a rapidly growing field, as more and more investors, businesses, and governments act to support projects that fund climate mitigation and adaptation. The landscape is complex and evolving with growing calls for innovation and reform. The Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA&amp;rsquo;s Women in Energy initiative and the Columbia Energy Association invite you to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of energy finance and learn more about professional opportunities available in the space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the field of climate finance will continue to be a vital tool for addressing the climate crisis in the coming years. This event will feature a variety of representatives from energy finance backgrounds to share their knowledge and discuss the different career paths available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Women in Energy envisions a world with equal gender representation at every level within the energy sector. Our mission is to elevate women and enhance inclusion within the energy workforce by developing and sharing research, expanding entry into the sector, and supporting professionals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To expand entry into the sector, Women in Energy hosts events to provide opportunities to connect energy organizations recruiting new talent with those interested in pursuing a career. Our events also feature women who have thrived in specific energy sub-sectors sharing their experiences and career journeys. Join us to learn more about our work or contact us at womeninenergy@columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is open to the public and will be hosted in person in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advance registration is required.

Circuit, where many of our most crucial cases are resolved&amp;mdash;or teed up for the Supreme Court. He has championed equal justice for his entire adult life; decided landmark environmental and voting cases; and embodied the ideal of what a great judge should be. Yet he has been blind for the past 50 of his 80-plus years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, he depended upon aides to read texts to him, and more recently, a suite of hi-tech solutions has allowed him to listen to reams of documents at high speeds. At first, he tried to hide his deteriorating vision, and for years, he denied that it had any impact on his career. Only recently, partly thanks to his first-ever guide dog, Vixen, has he come to fully accept his blindness and the role it&amp;#39;s played in his personal and professional lives. His story of fighting for justice over many decades, with and without eyesight, is an inspiration to us all.&lt;/p&gt;",

Did microfinance take a wrong turn, or was it flawed from the beginning? Mara Kardas-Nelson&amp;rsquo;s We Are Not Able to Live in the Sky is about unintended consequences, blind optimism, and the decades-long ramifications of seemingly small policy choices. The book is rooted in the stories of women borrowers in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Their narratives, woven through a deep history of modern international development, are set against the rise of Yunus&amp;rsquo;s vision that tiny loans would &amp;ldquo;put poverty in museums.&amp;rdquo; Kardas-Nelson asks: What is missed with a single, financially focused solution to global inequity that ignores the real drivers of poverty? Who stands to benefit and, more important, who gets left behind?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Backyard Bankers: Immigrants, Savings Clubs and the Persuit of the American Dream&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The essence of money? &amp;nbsp;A quarter of a billion immigrants living in rich countries mobilize and distribute over a half trillion dollars a year in savings circles that they organize and manage themselves. These groups are based on savings traditions honed over generations that have enabled their home villages to build up the reserve of capital that helped them survive. In rich countries immigrants use the savings mobilized in their groups at the lowest level to survive. All this occurs outside the institutional financial system - banks, even credit unions, or government sponsored enterprise development programs - and is based on disciplined savings, mutual accountability, and trust within a context of strong families and unified communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://cglink.me/2e9/r1928008\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;",

The monthly seminars take place on the second Wednesday of the month, 2:00-3:00 PM EST. The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, November 13th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Genevera Allen, Professor of Statistics (IICD &amp;amp; Zuckerman Institute), Columbia University. Seminar hosted by Simon Tavar&amp;eacute;. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus). If you wish to attend the seminar remotely, please register using the following link: &lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMtcOCgrz4oHdG8qHyeXjEQTmLjcD1RkhXE\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMtcOCgrz4oHdG8qHyeXjEQTmLjcD1RkhXE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title: &lt;/strong&gt;Developing Reliable Machine Learning Interpretations Through Validation and Statistical Inference&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used throughout science and biomedicine to make discoveries from troves of data. But, are these data-driven discoveries reliable? Many such discoveries are made using statistical models or interpretable machine learning techniques, which provide human understandable interpretations of blackbox systems. Unlike for prediction tasks, however, it is difficult to directly test the veracity of ML interpretations. In this talk, we first present findings from a systematic, large-scale empirical reliability study on popular ML interpretations for both supervised and unsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our results reveal that ML interpretations are generally unreliable, and dramatically less reliable than ML predictions. Given these negative findings, we secondly ask: How can we improve the reliability of ML interpretations? We discuss the challenging task of validation for ML interpretations, presenting practical strategies like stability and generalizability as well as approaches to quantify the uncertainty of interpretations through statistical inference. We conclude with several real examples of how to apply such approaches to make reliable discoveries from large-scale biomedical data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Genevera Allen is a Professor of Statistics. She is also an Investigator at the Zuckerman Institute for Mind, Brain, and Behavior and a core faculty member at the the Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics. Prior to this, Dr. Allen spent fourteen years at Rice University in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science; she was also the Founder and served as the Faculty Director of Rice&amp;#39;s data science education center, informally known as the Rice D2K Lab. Dr. Allen&amp;rsquo;s research develops new statistical machine learning tools to help people make reliable discoveries from large and complex data. She is known for her methods and theory work in the areas of unsupervised learning, interpretable machine learning, data integration, graphical models, and high-dimensional statistics. Her work is motivated by solving real scientific problems, especially in the areas of neuroscience and computational biology. Dr. Allen is the recipient of several honors including a National Science Foundation Career Award, Rice University&amp;rsquo;s Duncan Achievement Award for Outstanding Faculty, and in 2014, she was named to the &amp;ldquo;Forbes &amp;rsquo;30 under 30&amp;prime;: Science and Healthcare&amp;rdquo; list. She is also an elected fellow of the American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and International Statistics Institute.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes are responsible for some of the most costly and devastating disasters to impact the USA, as recent events like Hurricane Helene have underscored. While hurricanes play a crucial role in Earth&amp;#39;s climate system, their characteristics are increasingly influenced by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join us on November 13th for a lecture on our current understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is modifying the characteristics of hurricanes. Suzana Camargo will examine both the changes we can already detect in recent years and the projections for the end of the century. The lecture will begin with a brief overview of hurricane science and notable historical cases before analyzing the effects of global warming on these powerful storms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzana Camargo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suzana Camargo is originally from Brazil and has been working at Columbia University since 1999. She is currently the Marie Tharp Lamont Research Professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. She is an expert on the relationship between extreme weather events and climate, in particular, hurricanes and typhoons. She was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2023 in recognition for her research in those topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory seeks fundamental knowledge about the origin, evolution, and future of the natural world. Its scientists study the planet from its deepest interior to the outer reaches of its atmosphere, on every continent and in every ocean, providing a rational basis for the difficult choices facing humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please click the link above for more information and to register for this event; https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-influence-of-climate-change-on-hurricanes-tickets-1041321359217?aff=oddtdtcreator&lt;/p&gt;",

Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Esfir Shub has become a mythic figure within Soviet film history as one of the founders of Soviet documentary cinema and a pioneer of the found footage film. Moreover, her importance extends beyond the boundaries of national cinema, as she has undoubtedly become a part of the documentary film canon and the canon of women&amp;rsquo;s film history. Despite her fame and importance, for a long time, Shub has been pigeonholed as a compilation filmmaker and rarely studied outside of her early found footage films. This talk seeks to reposition Shub and her contribution to the domain of documentary by exploring her theoretical thought. Shub conceived of documentary cinema not as a fixed category but as something perpetually evolving. She treated her films not as finished works but as a first step in a discursive process. Taking inspiration from Shub herself the talk reframes the idea of documentary film theory and focuses on the questions her films elicited and the conversations they generated. By analyzing Shub&amp;#39;s documentaries in conjunction with her short publications and archival materials about the films&amp;rsquo; production and reception, the talk discusses important theoretical notions explored by Shub in her works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;",

The lead up to the election has been unlike any we have ever seen, with a top ticket candidate change, a former president running for reelection, and domestic issues and global events shaping the conversation. In the aftermath of the 2024 election, we will dive into the key points that influenced the final days of the election, whether or not the polls got it right this year, and what changes the new administration might bring. Join us to hear leaders in the field of political analytics discuss key insights from the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion will highlight the importance of political analytics days after the conclusion of this year&amp;#39;s election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Del Percio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Founder, Susan Del Percio Strategies; MSNBC Political Analyst&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jefrey Pollock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Founding Partner &amp;amp; President, Global Strategy Group&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basil Smikle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of Practice &amp;amp; Director, M.S. in Nonprofit Management Program, Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alissa Stollwerk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice President, YouGov Blue&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information, please contact Robert Cummings,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/political-analytics-insights-from-the-2024-election-registration-1042027290677?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;rc3581@columbia.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/political-analytics-insights-from-the-2024-election-registration-1042027290677?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;inquire@sps.columbia.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staging Witchcraft Before the Law: Skepticism, Performance as Proof, and Law as Magic in Early Modern Witch Trials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nby Julie Stone Peters&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the judicial machinery of early modern witch-hunting could work with terrifying swiftness, skepticism, and evidentiary barriers often made conviction difficult. Seeking proof strong enough to overcome skepticism, judges and accusers turned to performance, staging &amp;ldquo;acts of Sorcery and Witch-craft manifest to sense.&amp;rdquo; Looking at an array of demonological treatises, pamphlets, documents, and images, this study shows that such staging answered to specific doctrines of proof: catching the criminal &amp;ldquo;in the acte&amp;rdquo;; establishing &amp;ldquo;notoriety of the fact&amp;rdquo;; producing &amp;ldquo;violent presumptions&amp;rdquo; of guilt. But performance sometimes overflowed the demands of doctrine, behaving in unpredictable ways. A detailed examination of two cases &amp;ndash; the 1591 case of the French witch-demoniac Fran&amp;ccedil;oise Fontaine and the 1593 case of John Samuel of Warboys &amp;ndash; suggests the manifold, multilayered ways that evidentiary staging could signify &amp;ndash; as it can still in that conjuring practice we call law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://english.columbia.edu/content/julie-stone-peters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Stone Peters&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is the H.

A scholar of law and humanities and media history, she studies performance, film, digital, and legal cultures across the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;longue dur&amp;eacute;e&lt;/em&gt;. Her most recent books are&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Staging Witchcraft Before the Law: Skepticism, Performance as Proof, and Law as Magic in Early Modern Witch Trials&lt;/em&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 2024) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Law as Performance: Theatricality, Spectatorship, and the Making of Law in Ancient, Medieval, and Early Modern Europe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2022). Previous scholarly publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Theatre of the Book: Print, Text, and Performance in Europe 1480-1880&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2000),&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s Rights, Human Rights: International Feminist Perspectives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(co-edited, Routledge, 1995), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Congreve, the Drama, and the Printed Word&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Stanford University Press, 1990).

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/valentina-izmirlieva/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The history of the Soviet Union can be defined by periods of atrocity, genocide, and warfare. The Soviet Gulag, the Holocaust, and the civilian and military engagement in World War Two produced unfathomable mass death in sites across the entire USSR for a half-century. Music and sound provide an instant, humanizing, and immersive understanding of these atrocities. In four case studies, Birch will provide examples of how we can hear the Holocaust, the Gulag, Terror, and exile. She will discuss Weinberg&amp;rsquo;s sonic fragment&amp;rsquo;s taken to Tashkent and covertly buried in his violin sonata during a peak of Soviet antisemitism in 1948, sonically describe the Gulag between field recordings of Karlag and the recovered music of Nosyrev and Zaderatsky, look at the overlap between Nazi and Soviet occupation of indigenous space and present Saami recordings as reassertion against epistemicide, and discuss how we can hear the Holocaust in the Soviet context both with recovered music (Tyrmand, Leyvand) and through sound. Finally, where do we go from here? In the wake of renewed Russian expansion and aggression, how do composers like Khanon, Gubaidulina, and Stolyar provide a sonic and intellectual intervention against terror? Rather than an intellectualized view of political violence, music and sound connect us to impossible catastrophe and create an emotional and evocative response to historical events.&lt;/p&gt;",

Her projects have been exhibited internationally and supported by the Graham Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation, the Pulitzer Center, and the Mellon Foundation, among others. She writes about landscape representation, extraction, and the visual narratives of climate change, and has been featured in the New Yorker, the Oxford American, the British Journal of Photography, and National Geographic. She lives in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In South Louisiana, where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, water&amp;mdash;and the history of controlling it&amp;mdash;is omnipresent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Into the Quiet and the Light: Water, Life, and Land Loss in South Louisiana&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;glimpses the vulnerabilities and possibilities of living on the water during an ongoing climate catastrophe and the fallout of the fossil fuel industry&amp;mdash;past, present, and future. The book sustains our physical, mental, and emotional connections to these landscapes through a collection of photographs by Virginia Hanusik. Framing the architecture and infrastructure of South Louisiana with both distance and intimacy, introspection and expansiveness, this work engages new memories, microhistories, anecdotes, and insights from scholars, artists, activists, and practitioners working in the region. Unfolding alongside and in dialogue with Hanusik&amp;rsquo;s photographs, these reflections soberly and hopefully populate images of South Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s built and natural environments, opening up multiple pathways that defy singularity and complicate the disaster-oriented imagery often associated with the region and its people. In staging these meditations on water, life, and land loss, this book invites readers to join both Hanusik and the contributors in reading multiplicity into South Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s water-ruled landscapes. With texts from Richie Blink, Imani Jacqueline Brown, Jessica Dandridge, Rebecca Elliott, Michael Esealuka, T.

NVIDIA experts will lead the session where you will utilize code samples in two main categories to introduce you to Python GPU accelerated computing. First, we will explore drop-in replacements for SciPy and NumPy code through the CuPy library. Second, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover NVIDIA RAPIDS, which provides GPU acceleration for end-to-end data science workloads. We&amp;#39;ll finish with an end-to-end example that incorporates all the tools introduced to tackle a geospatial problem. By the end of the workshop, you&amp;#39;ll have the skills to start accelerating your own Python codes with GPUs!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is organized by &lt;a href=\"https://www.cuit.columbia.edu/rcs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;CUIT Research Computing Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in partnership with NVIDIA.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Please join the Harriman Institute for a symposium devoted to Maria Stepanova&amp;#39;s new poem,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Holy Winter&lt;/em&gt;. This literary symposium brings together the author, her translators and publishers, and literary scholars to reflect on the poem as a literary artifact, a social fact, and a reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How is a poem that relates to the catastrophic events of the day&amp;mdash;the pandemic and the war&amp;mdash;conceived and written? Maria Stepanova will share her reflections on the creative process. How does the poem reach its readers, in the country of its origin and beyond? What is the role of publishers, editors, translators? What is lost (and gained) in translation? Stepanova&amp;#39;s translators and publishers will speak about their work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What poetic themes, instruments and forms are used in this highly innovative work of literature? How do we attend to the many voices speaking in the poem? How do we relate to its complex intertextual fabric? How do the poem&amp;rsquo;s recurrent imagery and metaphors&amp;mdash;exile, confinement, war&amp;mdash;speak to us about our own experience as we transition from the twentieth to the twenty-first century? Literary scholars will offer their interpretations as well as readerly impressions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;When Germany&amp;rsquo;s colonial empire in Africa and Asia collapsed during the First World War, a brief yet incredibly violent regime came to an end for affected societies. In the following decades, they had to fend with the aftermath of the German empire&amp;rsquo;s violent paroxysms, whether in the case of the genocide of the Herero and Nama in Namibia (1904-1908), the Maji Maji War in Tanzania (1905-1907), or other conflicts. At the same time, remembering this particularly violent yet transient colonial regime also became a way for affected societies to formulate demands for and practice self-determination. The talk explores this relationship between memories of colonialism and the making of postcolonial sovereignty based on the example of Herero communities in Namibia between the final years of German rule and the present day: kinship relations, cultural practices, and anti-colonial politics all became theaters of remembrance and sovereignty in which the contours of the present global conjuncture in reparative politics began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fabian Krautwald (PhD) is a comparative historian of modern eastern and southern Africa interested in memories of mass violence, decolonization, and print culture. Krautwald studies the ways in which African societies have defined their relationship to the past and the future, and how these changing relationships affected notions of sovereignty and justice on the continent. He works as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in African History at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*Reception to follow&lt;/p&gt;",

After studying history and visual sociology at the Sorbonne, she began her career as a documentary filmmaker. Her short and medium length films were selected and awarded prizes in several festivals, include &lt;em&gt;Les S&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;galaises et la S&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;gauloise&lt;/em&gt; (2007), &lt;em&gt;La Mort de Danton&lt;/em&gt; (2011), &lt;em&gt;La Permanence&lt;/em&gt; (2016) and &lt;em&gt;Towards Tenderness&lt;/em&gt; (2016), which won the C&amp;eacute;sar for Best Short Film in 2017. Her feature length documentary &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; (2021) won the Best Documentary Award as well as Best Film in the Encounters section at the Berlin Film Festival in 2021. She explained her documentary approach by saying, &amp;ldquo; For 15 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making films from the margins, with a political intention of filming those margins &amp;ndash; the &lt;em&gt;banlieue&lt;/em&gt;, people who have been silenced, because those are the people I come from. That&amp;rsquo;s my territory, my history.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alice Diop made her fiction film debut in 2023 with &lt;em&gt;Saint-Omer&lt;/em&gt;, based on the true story of a Senegalese woman who stood trial for infanticide in France.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Saint-Omer &lt;/em&gt;won her international acclaim as well as two awards at the Venice International Film Festival, and it was France&amp;rsquo;s entry for the best international feature at the Academy Awards in 2023, making Diop the first black woman ever to represent France in the Oscar race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mame-Fatou Niang&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor of French Studies, the Founder | Director of the Center for Black European Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, and an Artist-in-Residence at Ateliers M&amp;eacute;dicis.&lt;/p&gt;",

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/lynn-garafola/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynn Garafola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Dr. Konaev considers the shift in Russia&amp;#39;s cultural politics in 2008-2012 from a pro-European, liberal position supportive of contemporary art to its obscurantist opposite--part of Putin&amp;#39;s survival strategy after the 2011 Bolotnaya protests and especially after the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Indeed, it was just after the annexation of Crimea that the Kremlin introduced &amp;ldquo;Fundamentals of State Cultural Policy&amp;rdquo; and determined to build it on the statement &amp;quot;Russia is not Europe.&amp;quot; To facilitate implementation of the new state values (isolationism, militarism, antifeminism, and homophobia), Putin cultural officials started replacing the post-Soviet conception of state funding as an unconditional obligation of the state and reparation for the damage caused in Soviet times with the idea that all funding implies loyalty, thereby making funding a tool used to threaten those perceived as disloyal with imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the decade 2012-22 was marked by intense experimentation with forms, genres, and techniques in Russian ballet, contemporary dance, and opera ; rethinking the notion of theatre and the role of the audience ; the conceptualization, decentralization, and introduction of performative and site-specific practices ; implementing and expanding inclusivity ; and resisting official attempts to impose new state values on the theater community or devalue the professional standing of groups like the Golden Mask National Theatre Award. Dr Konaev analyzes the most significant trends and achievements of this period, as well as the forces of resistance, which the Putin state never underestimated and ultimately treated as an existential threat equating artists with radical terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a planet filled with millions of species, it is only natural to wonder what life would be like as a different animal. Although nonhuman animals can&amp;rsquo;t exactly talk to us about what they&amp;rsquo;re thinking and feeling, scientists have been able to peek into their minds through careful observation and clever experiments. What is it like to experience the world primarily through a sense we don&amp;rsquo;t often focus on, like smell, or through a sense humans don&amp;rsquo;t have at all? How does an animal&amp;rsquo;s perception of its surroundings shape its own sense of self? In this event, three experts come together from cognitive science, neuroscience, and biology to shed light on the rich inner lives of animals and guide us as we step into a completely different world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://barnard.edu/profiles/alexandra-horowitz\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alexandra Horowitz, MS, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Author and Professor, Sr. Research Fellow and Head of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, Columbia University, will begin by leading us on a journey that starts close to home as we venture into the world of dogs. Drawing from her bestselling books, she will share her research studying canine behavior and how dogs lead their lives nose-first, through their exceptional sense of smell. Dogs and their human companions visit her lab where they complete cleverly designed puzzles, games, and tasks, allowing researchers to watch what dogs do and get a glimpse into their mind. How do dogs formulate an understanding of themselves, their people, and our shared world through scent?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nathaniel-sawtell-phd\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nathaniel Sawtell, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Neuroscience and Principal Investigator at Columbia&amp;#39;s Zuckerman Institute, will then take us to a species that appears much more alien: the electric fish. Living in very muddy waters makes seeing with eyes a challenge. However, these fish have a sensory superpower that allows them to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; their environment and each other by sending and detecting electric signals. What is the neural circuitry that allows these fish to process this type of information? By studying the brain and behavior of the electric fish, Dr. Sawtell&amp;rsquo;s research reveals how an animal&amp;rsquo;s sensory world can shape its approach to learning, making decisions, and thriving in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the two talks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://jlzung.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jessica Zung, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Kanzer Postdoctoral Fellow in the the lab of Dr. Gwyneth Card at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Zuckerman Institute, will moderate a discussion and Q&amp;amp;A with the speakers. Audience questions are welcomed, either submitted during registration or live during the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can register &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/snf-brain-insight-lecture-inside-the-lives-and-minds-of-animals-tickets-1043991816627?utm-campaign=social&amp;amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;amp;utm-medium=discovery&amp;amp;utm-term=listing&amp;amp;utm-source=cp&amp;amp;aff=ebdsshcopyurl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This talk is part of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Brain Insight Lecture series, offered free to the public to enhance understanding of the biology of the mind and the complexity of human behavior. The lectures are hosted by Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and supported by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. All registrants will receive a Zoom link to watch the event livestream virtually and a recording of the lecture shortly after the event concludes.&lt;/p&gt;",

Five years later, he moved to Egypt to become the main spokesman of an Arab Sufi reformist movement based in Cairo. Agu&amp;eacute;li- the first to ever coin the word &amp;ldquo;Islamophobia&amp;rdquo;- warned against the European demonization of Islam and believed that a new universal and mystical pact should replace Western modernity. This talk offers a close examination of one of Agu&amp;eacute;li&amp;rsquo;s paintings, &amp;ldquo;Portrait of an Egyptian Woman,&amp;rdquo; and reads it in light of the artist&amp;rsquo;s political affiliation to a Sufi movement that aimed to bring a mystical solution to Western imperialism. By asking whether this is an Orientalist painting, this talk explores the interplay between personal biographies and Orientalism in art historical discourses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CU/ID holders, please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAll others interested in attending, please email the SOF/Heyman at&amp;nbsp;sofheyman@columbia.edu&lt;/p&gt;",

The dozens of buildings and projects by legendary architects &amp;ndash; from mid-century titans such as Eero Saarinen and I. M. Pei to contemporary practitioners Deborah Berke and IwamotoScott &amp;ndash; remain integral to its urban fabric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Modern: Architecture; Community; Columbus, Indiana&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;explores Columbus&amp;rsquo;s optimistic program of bold new architecture and landscapes, initiated by the legendary industrialist J. Irwin Miller and local leaders, and the generations-long quest to develop the ideal American city through design excellence. This is the first in-depth history of Columbus, Indiana, demonstrating the unique convergence of civic, industrial, and social forces that produced the pre-eminent laboratory of architectural modernism in the USA. It presents a rich showcase of outstanding, generation-spanning architects and is published in association with Landmark Columbus Foundation, the civic organization behind the progressive preservation and promotion of the city&amp;rsquo;s architectural heritage, as well as the producer of the acclaimed program Exhibit Columbus, a two-year cycle of events that uses the context of Columbus to host conversations around innovative ideas and then commissions site-responsive installations in a free, public exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.phaidon.com/monacelli/architecture/american-modern-architecture-community-columbus-indiana-9781580936125/\"&gt;Learn more about&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Modern: Architecture, Community; Columbus, Indiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/strong&gt;, a Columbus, Indiana native, is an author, editor, and columnist.

This talk discusses an emerging model of generating new chemicals, intermediates, soft matter and energy storage components from biomass. Our continued efforts over two decades in this area have led us to develop new materials from molecules derived from industrial by-products and co-products. The family of new materials generated include molecular gels, solid bilayers, scintillating gels, battery components, liquid crystals, and polymers. Intriguingly, following the principles of green and supramolecular chemistry, we have developed building blocks-to-assembled materials viz environmentally benign antibacterial paints, oil spill recovery materials, energy storage devices, vegetable oil structuring agents and cancer detecting gels. These results will lead to efficient molecular design of supramolecular architectures, soft matter, and next generation multifunctional interfacial chemicals from underutilized plant/crop-based renewable feedstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to download\n\n\n\nDate:\nOctober 28, 2024\nTime:\n12:00 PM \u2014 1:00 PM\nCollege:\nThe City College of New York\nAddress:\nCity College of New York 181 Convent Avenue New York, NY 10031\nManhattan\nBuilding:\nMarshak Building, Room 1027 In-person\nPhone:\n212-650-8402\nAdmission:\nFree, Refreshments will be served.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.ccny.cuny.edu/chemistry",

Using Kamara\u2019s\u00a0body of work, colonial archival documents, and postcolonial knowledge production\u00a0within\u00a0Senegal,\u00a0I make a case for a literary and intellectual-historical approach to the\u00a0field of Islam in Africa.

A philosophical perspective for the contemporary world and for future generations must think of new paradigms of coexistence starting from the living body, a \u201csingular plural\u201d political entity that grounds the community, and from the con-tact between bodies as an expression of the sense of the \u201cin-common\u201d. Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s haptic ontology, reread through Irigaray and Derrida, identifies the experience of touching as the basis of inter-human relations and that of breathing as a shared right between humanity and the biosphere.",

    "description": "The Sociology Department at the New School for Social Research presents a talk by Dr. Anna Schwenck of the University of Siegen (Department of Social Sciences) on her award-winning book, Flexible Authoritarianism.\u00a0Winner of the 2024 Mary Douglas Prize for Best Book in the Sociology of Culture, Dr. Schwenck\u2019s book challenges the notion that authoritarianism's transnational rise constitutes a backlash against economic globalization. Describing a governmental approach that simultaneously incentivizes a can-do spirit and suppresses dissent, the book points out resonances between authoritarian and neoliberal ideologies in today's comeback of strongman rule. Drawing on field observations, in-depth interviews, and analyses of video clips, it conveys the look and feel of flexible authoritarianism in Russia through the eyes of up-and-coming youth. The author analyzes ways in which the insignia of cool start-up capitalism and familiar cultural forms such as the summer camp help stabilize the regime, while also showing how up-and-coming youth both embrace and contest loyalty to the government.\u00a0Bio: Anna Schwenck\u2019s research lies at the intersection of cultural and political sociology. She is particularly interested in how cultural understandings, be they transnational or locally specific, shape political behaviour.\u00a0 She studied the resonances between authoritarianism and neoliberalism in Russia, pandemic and science skepticism in German-speaking countries, and processes of re-traditionalization in popular music cultures. Her recent work investigates the role of liberation songs and narratives in conventional and contentious politics in South Africa. \u00a0Anna is employed at the University of Siegen\u2019s department of social sciences and the Siegen-based collaborative research centre \u201cTransformations of the Popular\u201d (SFB 1472). She is also a visiting researcher at the University of the Western Cape\u2019s Anthropology Department in South Africa. She earned a PhD in Sociology and an MA in Social Sciences from Humboldt University Berlin, as well as a BA in Cultural Studies from Viadrina European University, Frankfurt (Oder). She was a visiting student/scholar at University College London's School of Slavonic and East European Studies, the Sociology Department at the University of California (Berkeley), and the Russian State University for the Humanities (Moscow).",

In the historical 12th street auditorium, where Martin Luther King gave his lectures on the American race crisis, and next to the room that Orozco filled with images of revolution, we will be asking ourselves: Where is the revolution gone? How is change possible in an epoch when everything has to be produced \u201cJust-in-time\u201d? What could the revolution of our time look like? The musical prelude will tell us the story of a society that has decided to apply the principle of accelerated change to all aspects of social life, while the speakers assembled in the reading will speculate about where we might possibly be heading.\u00a0The musical prelude will feature:Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re, concept, musical composition & videoChiara Bottici, libretto and narrationCamilla Hoitenga, flutistMatteo Procuranti, libretto, actor and stage directorTimo Rissanen and Otto Von Busch, costumes.\u00a0Speakers will include, among others: Austin Burke, Nancy Fraser, Lydia Goehr, Gwenda-lin Grewal, Lewis Gordon, Ashley Jones, Francesca Romana Recchia-Luciani, Veronica Dakota Padilla, Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Romy Opperman, Rose Rejouis, Nicol Shestani and McKenzie Wark.",

    "description": "Join Dominic Pettman,\u00a0University Professor of Media and New Humanities, as he launches\u00a0his new book, Telling the Bees: An Interspecies Monologue, in conversation with Elvia Wilk, NSSR Liberal Studies alum and author of Oval\u00a0and Death by Landscape.\u00a0In a bid to wean himself off social media, media scholar and cultural theorist Dominic Pettman decided to revive an ancient custom. He decided to tell the local bees of his thoughts, theories, musings, and meditations. The result was an apian journal that parses the daily news and the routines of modern life in a more sustained and reflective way than the Pavlovian posts to which we are so addicted.The account that emerges from Pettman\u2019s regular discussion with the bees forms a compelling portrait of the tumultuous period running from the Fall of 2019 to New Year\u2019s Eve 2022. What began as a reflection on the traumatic effects of an \u201cunprecedented\u201d presidency soon evolved into a real-time response to the equally extraordinary events of the pandemic and its aftermath.One key concern that emerges from Pettman\u2019s ongoing discussion with the bees is the extent to which, thanks to the alienating effects of neoliberalism, we were already engaged in an advanced form of social distancing long before anyone had heard of COVID. Other key themes include education, human-animal relations, climate change, mediated intimacy, attention ecologies, collective memory, slow violence, the self-fulfilling prophecy that is New York City, the never-ending end of history, and the mundane strategies we share in a bid to forge on, despite the accumulating challenges of the twenty-first century.Telling the Bees is an invitation to rediscover the art of reflection and a profound meditation on human connection, alienation, and our collective yearning for intimacy in an age of distance.",

    "description": "Join us for an engaging Industry Talk featuring bold artists working at the intersection of creativity and activism in West Africa. Cutting-edge Ghanaian visionaries, Joewackle Kusi, Maame Adjei, and Percy Osei-Appiah (Mutombo) will share their experiences navigating the challenges of media-making in politically charged environments amid a rise in censorship.\u00a0This panel will explore the ethical and practical dilemmas faced by filmmakers, producers, and artists while championing marginalized voices and identities such as Kusi\u2019s bold examination of queer narratives in Nyame Mma; Maame Adjei\u2019s award winning directorial debut in \u201cThe Whites of our Eyes\u201d; and Mutombo's intimate storytelling.\u00a0\u00a0This Industry Talk is essential for students to grasp the real-world consequences of\u00a0censorship, creative suppression, and the ethical responsibilities of media creators. With\u00a0diverse backgrounds in film, television, photography, and poetry, the panelists provide\u00a0students with a multi-faceted understanding of how media can be used to represent\u00a0marginalized voices and challenge oppressive systems, making this an invaluable\u00a0earning opportunity for media managers and aspiring content creators alike.Don't miss this chance to engage with leading figures who are reshaping the landscape of media in Ghana and beyond!",

    "description": "Why mysticism? It has been called \u201cexperience in its most intense form,\u201d and in his new book, Mysticism (New York Review of Books, October 2024),\u00a0Simon Critchley, Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy, poses a simple question to the reader: Wouldn\u2019t you like to taste this intensity? Wouldn\u2019t you like to be lifted up and out of yourself into a sheer feeling of aliveness, both your life and those of the creatures that surround you? If so, it might be well worthwhile trying to learn what is meant by mysticism and how it can shift, elevate, and deepen the sense of our lives.\u00a0This event is part of The New School for Social Research's\u00a0General Seminar\u00a0event series.

    "title": "Trajectories of Authoritarianism in Democratic Regimes",
    "description": "In an era of global democratic decline, elected leaders have tapped economic and other grievances and resentments, harnessed new coalitions, and created popular narratives that legitimize the concentration of power in single parties and individuals. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India has compromised the integrity and independence of state institutions, and attacked civil society actors, media, academia, and opposition parties. But national elections earlier this year brought surprising results, with Modi\u2019s party losing its parliamentary majority and now governing through a coalition. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his ruling party were also handed a surprising electoral defeat in local elections in March 2024. Elections in the United States on November 5 for control of the presidency and Congress are among the most closely contested in recent decades, and with the results likely to face legal challenges after Election Day. Through a comparative discussion of India, Turkey, and the United States, this panel will explore how to understand the authoritarian turn, varying modes of repressive governance within democracies and bases of its support, and the channels through which opposition parties and social movements have navigated the fraught political landscape.",
