      "description": "The generational threats to our well-being caused by ecological disruptions and climate change fuel the climate crisis and its impacts in overburdened, frontline communities. As long as injustices persist, there will be a resolute fight for a livable future. How our society chooses to respond to these impacts and remake itself toward a livable future determines how we authentically live up to our social justice and racial equity ideals. There is no future without Climate and Environmental Justice.\u00a0Frontline movement leaders have been showing up and leading us for decades as champions of democracy, working to ensure that communities most affected by environmental issues have the power to create their desired solutions. Their work is essential in addressing systemic inequalities and empowering communities to take action. This year\u2019s Climate Week in New York City marks the 10-year anniversary of the 400,000-strong Peoples\u2019 Climate March, which was \u201ca shift in the national U.S. climate movement, in centering the leadership of\u00a0 Indigenous communities, communities of color, and working-class white communities who are both at the Frontlines of the Crises and the Forefront of Change.\u201dThis September, we invite you to join us for Climate Week events on campus and around the City. \u00a0 Let\u2019s come together as a community and collectively envision a better climate future, one where justice is at the core.\u00a0 Our keynote event will feature two prominent speakers, Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Stacey Abrams, who will lead a conversation on what we can do in the United States to reimagine a \u201cBetter world ahead.\u201dStay Tuned to this Climate Week Hub for upcoming events, and feel free to share widely.

In this film screening and discussion series, we will process this flood of images by attending to a particularly influential period of their production: the 1950s to 1980s. This period saw the return of location filming to the city and the reconceptualization of dirt as grit. Over the course of the fall, we will watch and discuss six films that exemplify six different ways in which these images have transformed our understanding of New York City.\u00a0\u00a0***All screenings are on Fridays at 7pm***- September 13 - Voyeur NYC: Rear Window (dir. Alfred Hitchcock, 1954)- September 27 - Ambitious NYC: Sweet Smell of Success (dir. Alexander Mackendrick, 1957)- October 11 - Lonely NYC: The Apartment (dir.

      "description": "The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict has provoked many emotions (rage, guilt, victimization, condemnation), and a sense of hopelessness for its resolution. It is important to understand that the tragic events of the past year have occurred in the context of an intractable conflict. Intractable conflicts are characterized by master narratives that explain and justify the conflict for both sides. They support the necessity of the conflict as a zero-sum game. They also demonize the enemy and provide the set of arguments that is often associated with religious and moral superiority.This series is faculty-led and will explore the current Israel/Palestine conflict through the dynamics of intractability which includes psychological, historical and political components. We will hear the voices of both Israelis and Palestinian experts on the conflict, psychologists who study the relational effects of these master narratives, and hear from activists, local and international ones, who propose alternatives in this dismal landscape. These events are also organized to fulfill the mission of a University meant to prepare students through education, knowledge, and dialogue.  The seminars is collated by faculty members Warren Spielberg (NSPE) and Benoit Challand (NSSR).\u00a0Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

Chinese description follows English description below.This free 10-week online seminar offers a series of timely debates conducted in Chinese and aimed at a global Chinese audience, focusing on important and controversial issues in Chinese politics and international relations that cannot be freely discussed inside China. In each 90-minute session, guest debaters who are authorities in the subject area will be randomly assigned to present pro and con positions on the following propositions; the audience will vote on each proposition before the debate and at the end of the debate, and will also have a chance to pose questions.\u00a0We hope to help Chinese in China and around the world think through their own positions on a variety of issues facing China at home and abroad.Debate topics include:\u00a01. Democracy is suitable for China2. The China Model works well; it should be emulated by other countries3. The majority of Chinese people support the Chinese Communist Party4. China\u2019s long-term strategic goal is to overthrow the rule-based international order5. The West\u2019s engagement policy toward China was a failure6. The way modern technology is developing helps drive the trend toward authoritarianism7. It is not enough for the U.S. to manage competition with China, it needs to promote regime change8.

      "description": "Anchored around John Adams' challenging and seldom performed \"Grand Pianola Music\", this exciting program features works by some of our greatest composers of Latin and American music.With the support of a full wind ensemble throughout, this program dances between varied Spanish, American, and Latin American styles all originating from the last century. The Spanish/Latin compositions by Rodrigo and Piazzolla center around traditional clave rhythms. Copland's \"Quiet City\" works with rhythmic freedom and lush, open chords that support the solo voices of trumpet and english horn. This \"American\" sound is also evident in the use of Adams' harmonic language, coupled with a minimalistic, yet complex, rhythmic drive. The addition of two harmonious pianos and 3 voices give new range to the sound of a wind ensemble, making \"Grand Pianola Music\" a unique, masterful composition like no other.\u00a0Program-Adagio Para Orquesta de Instrumentos de Viento - Joaqu\u00edn RodrigoQuiet City - Aaron CoplandTanguango - Astor Piazzolla (arr.

A photographer dedicated to the form of the photobook, Colin will be presenting work from\u00a0\u201cThe Line,\u201d his ongoing project of walking, researching, and photographing the Mason-Dixon Line.\u00a0\u201cThe Line\u201d oscillates between exploring the deep historical significance of the Mason-Dixon Line, understanding the current realities of living near this mythic border of freedom, and reflecting on Colin's own identity as someone who identifies as a southerner. The research started in the early years of the Presidency of Barack Obama and has continued through the current Biden administration.\u00a0Colin has authored photobooks published by RITA BOOKS (2015) and KGP+ (2017). In 2018, he began self-publishing his work to explore publishing as an art form. In 2021, he founded Nonlinear Books, an experimental publishing venture aimed at advancing the form, function, and language of the photobook. The primary focus of Nonlinear Books is addressing issues surrounding race, patriarchy, and disenfranchisement. A central tenet of this initiative is ensuring affordability for all, while also prioritizing support for underrepresented photobook makers.Colin's photobooks are included in collections at prominent institutions including The International Center of Photography Library, The New York Public Library, The New School Library, Ronald Feldman Gallery, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, The Sloane Art Library at the University of North Carolina, and the Hellenic Centre for Photography in Athens, Greece.\u00a0This seminar is a discussion of a pre-circulated work.

The panel is part of a series of public events coinciding\u00a0 with our current exhibition, Regeneration of Flax: Linseed, Linen, Shive & Oil at the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, 66 Fifth Avenue at 13th Street, New York.\u00a0With 60% of textile fibers made of synthetic polyester today, we look to the robust history of flax growing over the last 36,000 years, as a viable biobased alternative to synthetics.\u00a0 Flax is grown as a rotational crop and sequesters carbon as it grows. Flax fibers create linen fabrics, composites and insulation. Flax seed can be a food, or pressed into oils for finishes and flooring. Shive, a woody byproduct, is used for mulch and being researched for flaxlime.\u00a0 We will discuss the methods of farming organically and the potential of flax to remove heavy metals from soil. Experts will discuss the challenges of scaling, applications in the built environment\u00a0 and the benefits of local material sourcing for regional economies.\u00a0\u00a0What if designers were more connected with agriculture and the lifecycle of their materials?\u00a0The panel will be held from 5-6:30pm.\u00a0 The exhibition opening and reception 6:30-8pm.\u00a0RSVP Today!",

The ambition of the project is to furnish a general theoretical representation of how unpaid care giving and its (gendered) social structure contributes to the technical conditions of production in the sphere of marketed output. In so doing, it aims to provide macro theorists with an apparatus that allows consistent description of both short-term (levels of activity) and long-term (rates of growth) macro outcomes in a manner that routinely integrates feminist insights regarding the gendered structure of the social reproduction of labor into macroeconomic analysis.Non-New School community members: Please register to get access to the buildings, as those that don't and are not on the RSVP list may be refused by security.",

DIRECT ACTION is a contemporary portrait of one of the most high-profile militant activist communities in France: a 150-person strong rural collective that successfully resisted an international airport expansion project in 2018, created an autonomous zone between 2012 and 2018, survived multiple violent eviction attempts by the French state and spawned a new ecological movement in 2021.\u00a0Using a collaborative and immersive observational approach, the film documents the everyday lives of a diverse ecosystem of activists, squatters, anarchists, farmers and those labelled by the government as \u201ceco-terrorists\u201d. Can the success of a radical protest movement offer a path through the climate crisis?\u00a0Filmmakers Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau will discuss their new film.

      "title": "Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico Book Launch",
      "description": "Book launch of Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico, including panel discussion and reception.The Struggles for Memory against Violences in Mexico documents and analyzes the diversity of collective memory projects throughout Mexico since the start of the \u201cwar against drug cartels\u201d, in a context of various intersecting and ongoing forms of violence. There are now\u00a0more than 110,000 victims of enforced disappearance and the numbers grow every month. Memorialization has been acknowledged as an important tool in the context of mass human rights violations and is often seen as a symbolic form of reparation for the victims, predominantly after regime change or a clearly-defined end to large scale violence. Compared to other cases in Latin America and other parts of the world, this has not been the case in Mexico. The scholars, activists, families of victims, architects and artists that write in this book address the pressing questions that emerge from the particularity of the Mexican case: Why would activists use the language and aesthetics of commemoration in the midst of ongoing violence and human rights abuses? What is the function of commemoration in the absence of peace and justice? What does it mean to commemorate in the absence of evidence and in the absence of bodies (i.e. in the case of the disappeared)?The Struggles for Memory examines historical connections across mobilizations around collective memory in Mexico in the context of the dirty war of the 1960s and 1970s and recent events from the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa in 2014, to the women who search for mass graves around the country, among a number of other memorialization efforts around the country, some well-known and others not so widely disseminated. The book challenges the framing of the violence merely as an issue related to drugs and organized crime. These interventions show the continuities in state violence over time, drawing attention to forms of structural violence that cut across enforced disappearances, violence against women, migrant deaths, resource extraction, attacks on activists and journalists, and the enduring discrimination against indigenous peoples and the dispossession of their lands.

      "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Klaus Vieweg, \"Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics of Painting\"",
      "description": "Abstract: What connects Hegel with Rembrandt? What are the important points of contact between the grand master of modern philosophizing and the virtuosos of Dutch painting? Why does Hegel, as an outstanding representative of the school of German Idealism, the golden age of modern philosophy, recognize in the paintings of Rembrandt and the Dutch school of the Golden Age a greatness of spirit and freedom, a revolution in painting, the modernity of this art of painting? Why is Hegel fascinated by such pictures of proud citizens, vegetable and herring sellers, street urchins, the poor and beggars, landscapes and Dutch mills, farmers at harvest and in the inn, women playing the piano, canals with skaters, bouquets of flowers and breakfast tables - depictions of seemingly banal scenes of everyday life?By laying the foundations for a modern aesthetic theory in his lectures on the philosophy of art, Hegel provides decisive arguments against classicist and romanticist devaluations of Dutch Golden Age painting. Against the glorification of antiquity (classicism) and the Christian Middle Ages (late romanticism), his philosophy of art brought about a paradigm shift towards the art of modernity as free art, an art of free spirituality - \"only in its freedom is beautiful art true art\". Hegel can be regarded as the founder of a modern aesthetic of painting in the sense of combining philosophy and art history.Bio: Klaus Vieweg is Professor of Classical German Philosophy at the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena and one of the world's leading Hegel experts. Vieweg has authored or edited over two dozen books, including Hegel. Der Philosophie der Freiheit (Munich: 2019) translated into English as Hegel: The Philosopher of Freedom (Stanford 2023).",

Thank you!The Westerlies: Wherein Lies The Good\u00a0The origins of The Westerlies go back to the high school bandrooms of Seattle, Washington, where the four original members first met and came of age together. In this program, the ensemble returns to their roots to celebrate music from their hometown, including Wherein Lies the Good, an expansive work by Robin Holcomb originally written for solo piano, as well as works by her contemporaries Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, and Ron Miles.\u00a0Repertoire to include:Wherein Lies the Good \u2014 Robin HolcombSweeter Than The Day \u2014 Wayne HorvitzCupid \u2014 Ron MilesMonroe \u2014 Bill Frisell\u00a0All arrangements by The Westerlies.The Westerlies are the Ensemble-in-Residence at the\u00a0School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School College of Performing Arts\u00a0\u00a0Free with registration / Space is Limited!\u00a0The Westerlies:The Westerlies, \u201can arty quartet\u2026mixing ideas from jazz, new classical, and Appalachian folk\u201d (New York Times) are a New York-based brass quartet comprised of Riley Mulherkar and Chloe Rowlands on trumpet, and Andy Clausen and Addison Maye-Saxon on trombone. From Carnegie Hall to Coachella, The Westerlies navigate a wide array of venues and projects with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family sing-along.Formed in 2011, the self-described \u201caccidental brass quartet\u201d takes its name from the prevailing winds that travel from the West to the East. \u201cSkilled interpreters who are also adept improvisers\u201d (NPR\u2019s Fresh Air), The Westerlies explore jazz, roots, and chamber music influences to create the rarest of hybrids: music that is both \"folk-like and composerly, lovely and intellectually rigorous\u201d (NPR Music).The ensemble has produced numerous critically acclaimed albums of genre-defying music. 2022 saw the release of the Songbook Vol. 2 and Live at TOURISTS on Westerlies Records, the ensemble\u2019s in-house record label. The previous year was a prolific year for the ensemble, with the release of Fireside Brass: A Westerlies Holiday (Westerlies Records), Songbook Vol. 1 (Westerlies Records), and Bricolage (Westerlies Records), a collaborative album of improvisations with pianist/composer Conrad Tao. 2021 also saw the release of This Land, the ensemble\u2019s collaboration with GRAMMY-nominated vocalist Theo Bleckmann. Sought-after collaborators, The Westerlies are also featured on recordings by Fleet Foxes (Nonesuch), Big Red Machine (Jagjaguwar), Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 (Six Degrees Records), Common (Lakeshore) and Dave Douglas (Greenleaf).Education and community engagement are core elements of The Westerlies' mission. In 2021, The Westerlies were named the inaugural small ensemble-in-residence at the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music at The New School. The Westerlies also produce an annual music festival in Seattle called Westerlies Fest, which combines evening performances featuring numerous guest artists, an all-day open-to-the-public creative music jamboree, and workshops in local public schools. The Westerlies have engaged students of all ages and abilities around the country with their innovative assemblies and masterclasses, promoting the values of cooperation and inclusion through music.This performance will be LIVESTREAMED.

If we are smart, we listen, we follow these murmurs and we see where they lead.\u00a0 Jon-Sesrie Goff does just that in After Sherman. His florid documentary eavesdrops on fragmented dialogues: between father and son, among friends and neighbors, between land and river and, of course, between the past and the present. These conversations are ambitiously framed by the director, in his notes, as meditations on inheritance and our nation\u2019s twisted history. And while After Sherman fulfills that mission, it\u2019s most captivating when it burrows into Goff\u2019s personal history, recording the stories and rituals of his Gullah Geechee community\u201d \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarke",

      "description": "\u00a0What motivates the federal republic? Nearly 75 years since its creation and more than thirty since reunification, German democracy is under pressure: political extremism is spreading, the major political parties are battling vanishing approval ratings, and resentment and anti-democratic feelings are on the rise. How did we get here?Renowned historian Christina Morina believes that to understand modern German history, we need to stop thinking of it as a straightforward story of democracy and dictatorship. In her new book,\u00a0Tausend Aufbr\u00fcche (A Thousand New Beginnings, English edition in preparation for 2025), she examines countless letters to politicians, petitions, leaflets and other documents to show how citizenship and democracy have meant different things to different people over the past 40 years. For the first time, this\u00a0political-cultural history of modern Germany looks at the 1989 revolution in light of the history of German democracy \u2013 revealing the diverse and stubborn ways in which Germans from all walks of life, east and west, have approached democracy in theory and in practice, how their ideas are shaping the so-called Berlin Republic, and the associated opportunities and dangers.Christina Morina is the 2024-2025 Visiting Heuss Professor in History at The New School for Social Research. She is Professor of General History with a particular focus on Contemporary History at the University of Bielefeld. Her research focuses on major themes in German and European history from the in 19th to the 21st century, particularly Nazism and the history of bystanding during the Holocaust; socialism, Marxism and communism; political and memory culture(s) in Germany since 1945, as well as the history of historiography.This annual Heuss Lecture is part of The New School for Social Research's General Seminar event series.

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.Please note the Community Agreements for this event.",

Please click here to register for Day Two on October 18.The world is spiraling into climate chaos, and artificial intelligence (AI), despite its apparent promise, threatens democratic institutions the world over. What is driving the current race to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI? Why are tech billionaires like Elon Musk so obsessed with colonizing space and anxious about population decline? One aim of this symposium is to better understand the mindsets, both utopian and apocalyptic, that have become pervasive within Silicon Valley and beyond. We will consider a cluster of interrelated ideologies that inform these mindsets, among others, Effective Altruism (EA), transhumanism, longtermism, effective accelerationism, and singularitarianism.

      "title": "How (Not) to Build a Bunker, Day 2: Reinvigorating Democracy\u2014Rejecting AI Apocalypticism and Resisting the Rush to Build AGI",
      "description": "The Arendt/Sh\u00fcrmann Symposium at the Philosophy Department of The New School for Social Research present this\u00a0two-day conference running October 17-18, 2024. Please click here to register for Day One on October 17.The world is spiraling into climate chaos, and artificial intelligence (AI), despite its apparent promise, threatens democratic institutions the world over. What is driving the current race to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI? Why are tech billionaires like Elon Musk so obsessed with colonizing space and anxious about population decline? One aim of this symposium is to better understand the mindsets, both utopian and apocalyptic, that have become pervasive within Silicon Valley and beyond. We will consider a cluster of interrelated ideologies that inform these mindsets, among others, Effective Altruism (EA), transhumanism, longtermism, effective accelerationism, and singularitarianism. We hope to identify meaningful and effective strategies to counteract their growing influence.\u00a0Speakers: Amitav Ghosh, Tyler A.

      "description": "In China, recent reforms have aimed at expanding social security coverage, improving healthcare, and addressing rural-urban disparities. India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance. ",

      "title": "Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Domingues | Liberalism & Republicanism: From Expansion to Retraction",
      "description": "Political modernity set off, through liberalism and a modern form of republicanism, programmatically and historically, with a rather oligarchical and abstract perspective. Accordingly, most citizens \u2013 if they were citizens at all \u2013 did not participate, at least fully, in the political system and had only civil rights \u2013 limited in particular for women but also for specific groups of the population, foremostly slaves. Abstractness hid however these concrete issues, besetting workers and the popular classes in general, as well as women, also in their plebeian political being. Abstractness implied also the personalization and personification of politics should be strictly limited. Through social and political struggles concreteness penetrated however the structure of the state, democratizing the political system of liberal republicanism, broadening political rights, and introducing social policies and rights, tending often to universalization. Highly oligarchical mass organizations \u2013 parties, unions, associations, churches \u2013 were crucial for this expansive moment. This movement has been reversed since the 1970s, implying a moment of retraction of republican liberalism towards a sort of de-democratized advanced oligarchical political system, despite the formal trappings of democracy, and the restriction of social policies, concentrated on the poor rather them aiming at the citizen. Concreteness has not disappeared, though, with society cut out in different groups and the personalization and personification of politics (so-called \u201cpopulism\u201d). This movement is internal rather than inimical to liberalism. At the same time, the \u201creal socialist\u201d (authoritarian collectivism) failed and returned to capitalism, although keeping the party-state form. It does not appear any longer as an alternative at all. The question that remains is whether republican liberalism can resume its expansive movement or whether, as authoritarian collectivism, it is exhausted in its creative capacities and historical dynamics and in terms of propelling social forces.",

      "description": "Pleistocene Park is a large-scale science experiment in Arctic Siberia in the form of a future-oriented rewilding project with the goal of mitigating climate change. The Park\u2019s creators hypothesize that introducing large herbivores into the area will slow the thawing of permafrost. Using the approach of multispecies ethnography, in attending to the nonhuman agencies at work in the project, Anya Bernstein (Harvard) argues that the Park differs from other rewilding projects, which are usually ecocentric, in emerging as a survivalist project with a distinct anthropocentric bent. Even so, however, the Park\u2019s survivalist goal for humans coexists with ontologies based on collaboration and mutual aid between humans and nonhumans, and between organic and inorganic matter, with extensive agency assigned to nonhuman others. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork within the frame of the Park\u2019s various genealogies, she traces the project\u2019s underlying assumptions in equal measure to the history of Russian science and to the experience of the Park\u2019s lead scientists of sociopolitical rupture following the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a case study, Pleistocene Park is especially suited to exploring issues of time and temporality, apocalypticism and redemption, extinction and eternity, in addition to particular visions of the natural and the human.",

      "description": "Forgoing the expected stylization\u2014be it the imperative: Correct history! a call to revise and rewrite it, or the interrogative, Correct history?, questioning whether there might be a singular narrative\u2014the asterisk in the title Correct History* suggests a more conditional and hypothetical approach.\u00a0VLC Forum 2024: Correct History* explores the ways in which history and historiography invariably function as acts of correction and revision while examining some of the ideological mechanisms that drive them. Discursive strands come together to consider how historical narratives and ideological formations are created, edited, altered, and contested, including historical revisionism, whitewashing, and rehabilitation by state and other hegemonic political actors.\u00a0Over three days, the VLC Forum brings together scholars, artists, and curators whose reparative and recuperative artistic strategies point toward ways of redressing historical injustice, restitution of artifacts, memorialization, and negotiating conflict, competing claims, and historical relatedness.\u00a0Please visit the individual event pages for more information and to register to attend.",

      "title": "Philosophy Colloquium | Mohamed Amer Meziane, \"Of Subterranean\u00a0Imperiality:\u00a0Heaven, Earth, and the Accumulation of Capital\"",
      "description": "How is the State involved in the climate crisis?\u00a0Drawing on\u00a0The States of the Earth\u00a0(Verso, 2024), Mohamed Amer Meziane (Brown University) will attempt to develop a theory of what he calls the Fossil State, partly based on a critical dialogue with Marxism\u00a0that differs from most eco-socialist perspectives. He will suggest that the concept of\u00a0imperiality (not coloniality) might help us analyze the theologico-political knot underpinning the modern capitalist State in both its religious and secular forms. Because the State never exists as an isolated entity but as part of a system of interconnected states, I will turn to inter-imperiality to describe aspects of the geopolitics of climate beyond the opposition between war and peace. By reinterpreting \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d in terms not only of State/colonial violence but of imperial secularization (not secularism), he thus wants to contribute to a different understanding of the entanglements of colonialism and capital and to try and find overlaps between eco-Marxist and anti-colonial approaches.Bio:\u00a0Mohamed Amer Meziane holds a PhD in Philosophy and Intellectual History from the University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. After teaching at Columbia University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life, he joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor of Francophone Humanities and Middle East Studies affiliated with the Watson Institute. He is the author of The States of the Earth: An Ecological and Racial History of Secularization. The book won the Albertine Prize for non-fiction in 2023 and was published in English in April 2024 by Verso Books. His second book was published in French in 2023. It is titled: Au bord des mondes. Vers une anthropologie m\u00e9taphysique (At the Edge of the Worlds: Towards a Metaphysical Anthropology).\u00a0His books have been reviewed in several media such as Le Monde, Mediapart and The Los Angeles Review Books. He is also invited to write texts about several contemporary artists for exhibitions catalogs, art galleries or journals such as Flash Art. ",

      "description": "In an expansive conversation, Cree artist Kent Monkman and Nathan Young, a member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians, revisit some of the foundational narratives of the so-called United States of America, centering Indigenous figures, events, and narratives that have been erased and denied as part of the settler-colonial project.\u00a0Drawing on their own expansive artistic and scholarly work, including Monkman\u2019s widely-exhibited paintings that intervene in Western European and American art history and Young\u2019s Nkwilunt\u00e0m\u00ebn, a site-specific, sound-based installation in the landscape surrounding Pennsbury Manor, a reconstruction of the home of Pennsylvania founder William Penn, their conversation reckons with the processes of colonial erasure, the trope of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d unmaking of history, and Indigenous visual and sonic agency in contending with a settler-colonial history and the complexities of historic and contemporary Indigenous experiences. VLC Borderlands Curatorial Fellow Larissa Nez (Din\u00e9) introduces and moderates the conversation to ask: How can artists and historians correct or produce a \u201ccorrect\u201d record of Indigenous histories? How can historical scholarship and artistic practice work in tandem to re-envision Native pasts and futures?This program launches the VLC Forum 2024 and includes a festive reception.This event is part of the Vera List Center Forum 2024: Correct* History, please visit here for more information.",

In the foreword to the book, Mohaiemen wrote about the power-pleasing mania for enforcing \u201cshothik itihash\u201d (correct history). This was an invitation to think about the corrosive state-enforced obedient and hagiographic history being churned out of universities and publishing houses. This is a history that insisted there is only one narrative at every bend of Bangladesh's journey since the partition of British India.
